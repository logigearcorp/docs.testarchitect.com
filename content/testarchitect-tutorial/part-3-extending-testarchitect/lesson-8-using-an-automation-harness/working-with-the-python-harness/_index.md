How to implement TestArchitect actions using the Python programming language.

This subsection contains two exercises that demonstrate how to create user-scripted actions implemented in the Python programming language, and how to access such actions in your tests.

## Supported OS environments

-   Windows
-   Linux

## Supported Python version  

-   Python 2
-   Python 3

## Installing a Python interpreter

TestArchitect installation does *not* include a Python interpreter, which is a requirement for running Python scripts.

-   Linux: Linux machines come with Python 2.x pre-installed.
-   Windows: Windows does not, by default, include a Python interpreter. You may, however, easily obtain a free interpreter from the [Python Releases for Windows](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/) page of [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/).

In addition, please observe the following when installing an interpreter:

-   Use a Python interpreter that is no older than 3.x. \(TestArchitect has a set of import files that expose the automation library objects and functions to the interpreter. These files assume a Python version of 3.x.\).
-   Both TestArchitect and the Python interpreter must be for the same machine architecture \(32-bit or 64-bit\).

## Before proceeding...

Please ensure that you have Python installed before proceeding with the following examples. In addition, your systemâ€™s PATH variable must be set to include the path to the Python executable: for example, C:\\Python.

1.  [Developing your own User-scripted Python harness action](/testarchitect-tutorial/part-3-extending-testarchitect/lesson-8-using-an-automation-harness/working-with-the-python-harness/developing-your-own-user-scripted-python-harness-action)  
To created a scripted Python action, you must define the action, and modify the existing harness files to implement it.
2.  [Scripting an action in Python](/testarchitect-tutorial/part-3-extending-testarchitect/lesson-8-using-an-automation-harness/working-with-the-python-harness/scripting-an-action-in-python)  
 Implement an action in Python, using the TestArchitect Python harness.
3.  [Creating the test case and stub action](/testarchitect-tutorial/part-3-extending-testarchitect/lesson-8-using-an-automation-harness/working-with-the-python-harness/creating-the-test-case-and-stub-action)  
Create a stub action in TestArchitect as a placeholder for thescripted hello actionyou defined previously, then write a test to invoke the action.
4.  [Running a Python harness test](/testarchitect-tutorial/part-3-extending-testarchitect/lesson-8-using-an-automation-harness/working-with-the-python-harness/running-a-python-harness-test)  
Execute the test that calls the user-scripted action you implemented in thePython harness.
5.  [User-scripted Python harness action that interacts with GUI](/testarchitect-tutorial/part-3-extending-testarchitect/lesson-8-using-an-automation-harness/working-with-the-python-harness/user-scripted-python-harness-action-that-interacts-with-gui/)  
 In this exercise, we create a Python-scripted action that interacts with an AUT's user interface.
