You may at times find it necessary to do some things in your test that cannot be achieved with built-in actions, nor with the user-defined actions that build upon them. User-scripted actions allow you to write actions in a third-party programming language, such as Java, Python, orC\#.

Such user-scripted actions can be used to supplement the functionality of built-in TestArchitect actions. Examples of situations that call for user-scripted actions may include the need to access a specific API, or to perform a complex function like checking the sorting order of a table.

There are two essential tasks involved in creating a user-scripted action:

1.  Coding the action itself;
2.  Registering the action with TestArchitect, so that TestArchitect knows how to find it and interface with it.

The intended audiences include testers and automation engineers.

## Expected duration

**Prerequisites:**

-   Basic understanding of the TestArchitect user interface
-   Familiarity with the TestArchitect test editor
-   Essential understanding of TestArchitect repositories, projects and tests
-   Some familiarity with high level programming language\(s\), such as, Python, Java and C\#.

**What you will learn:**

-   How to invoke a user-scripted action
-   How to develop a custom user-scripted action
-   Accessing the methods and functions of the ABT library in your code
-   Writing harness script code to interact with a UI
-   Reporting results from a user-scripted action
