The exercises in this lesson guide you through the creation of a test that simulates a user logging into the sample application, populating a text field and clicking a button.

**Audience:** Testers, Automation engineers

**Prerequisites:**

-   Basic understanding of how a TestArchitect interface is used.
-   Familiarity with the TestArchitect test editor.
-   Essential understanding of TestArchitect repositories, projects and tests.

**What you will learn:**

-   Creating a test \(one that actually tests something\)
-   Making use of a TestArchitect interface in action lines
-   Running the test and viewing results
-   How to view test results

1.  [Starting the sample application](/testarchitect-tutorial/part-2-becoming-a-testarchitect-power-user/lesson-2-interfacing-with-a-gui/starting-the-sample-application)  
The Car Rental sample application mimics a reservation system for a fictitious car rental company. You will use this application in this lesson and others for your example tests.
2.  [Creating the test](/testarchitect-tutorial/part-2-becoming-a-testarchitect-power-user/lesson-2-interfacing-with-a-gui/creating-the-test)  
Build a new test module based on the interface of the Car Rental sample application, and create a simple test that interacts with the AUT.
3.  [Running the test](/testarchitect-tutorial/part-2-becoming-a-testarchitect-power-user/lesson-2-interfacing-with-a-gui/running-the-test)  
Execute your test to have TestArchitect perform the actions you defined in your test module.
