Execute a test with multiple data records \(rows\) supplied by a data set.

Once you have created a data set and a test that makes use of the data set, it is time to execute the test.

1.  With your test displayed in the editor, click **Execute** ![](/images//Images/btn.TAC_toolbar.Execute.png) on the toolbar.

    The Execute Test dialog box displays.

2.  Click **Execute**.

    The status bar \(at the bottom left of the TestArchitect window\) indicates the stages of the test as it progresses. Upon test completion the newly generated results page is displayed.

3.  Examine the results, to ascertain that it did use data from the data set.

    The results display a report line \(Quantity n of model...\) for each execution of the use data set/repeat data set loop, corresponding to each row in the data set:
