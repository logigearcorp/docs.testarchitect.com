In addition to data sets, text files residing outside of the TestArchitect repository may also be used to supply data to tests.

It is sometimes necessary to supply tests with data from sources that are external to the TestArchitect repository. To allow for this, TestArchitect accepts tab-delimited text files as input. Such files may be created manually or by an application, such as a database query program.

In the next exercise, you will move the data from the data set of the last exercise into an external file. Then you will adapt the same test sequence to accept data from that file, rather than the data set.
