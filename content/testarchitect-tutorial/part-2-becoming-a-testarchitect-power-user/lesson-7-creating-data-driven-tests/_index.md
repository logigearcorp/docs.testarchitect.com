Demonstrates how to enhance your tests with external test data to better simulate real-world user actions.

**Audience:** Testers, Automation engineers

**Prerequisites:**

-   Basic understanding of the TestArchitect user interface
-   Familiarity with the TestArchitect test editor
-   Essential understanding of TestArchitect repositories, projects, and tests

**What you will learn:**

-   Creating data sets
-   Incorporating data sets into your test
-   Reading data from external files
-   Filtering incoming data

1.  [Data-driven testing overview](/testarchitect-tutorial/part-2-becoming-a-testarchitect-power-user/lesson-7-creating-data-driven-tests/data-driven-testing-overview)  
With data-driven testing, a test sequence is executed repeatedly using values from a data source. For each test cycle, a different row of data is applied.
2.  [Data-driven tests](/testarchitect-tutorial/part-2-becoming-a-testarchitect-power-user/lesson-7-creating-data-driven-tests/data-driven-tests)  
Automated test sequences can be run repeatedly using sets of data supplied from a repository source external to the test.
3.  [Creating a data set](/testarchitect-tutorial/part-2-becoming-a-testarchitect-power-user/lesson-7-creating-data-driven-tests/creating-a-data-set)  
Data sets are sources of simulated real-world user data, and expected outcomes, for TestArchitect tests.
4.  [Creating a data-driven test](/testarchitect-tutorial/part-2-becoming-a-testarchitect-power-user/lesson-7-creating-data-driven-tests/creating-a-data-driven-test)  
Write a test that relies on an external data source \(a data set, in this case\) to simulate real-world user input.
5.  [Running the test](/testarchitect-tutorial/part-2-becoming-a-testarchitect-power-user/lesson-7-creating-data-driven-tests/running-the-test)  
 Execute a test with multiple data records \(rows\) supplied by a data set.
6.  [External data sources](/testarchitect-tutorial/part-2-becoming-a-testarchitect-power-user/lesson-7-creating-data-driven-tests/external-data-sources)  
 In addition to data sets, text files residing outside of the TestArchitect repository may also be used to supply data to tests.
7.  [Creating an external data source](/testarchitect-tutorial/part-2-becoming-a-testarchitect-power-user/lesson-7-creating-data-driven-tests/creating-an-external-data-source)  
Create a tab-delimited text file to supply data sets to your test.
8.  [Creating a dummy data set](/testarchitect-tutorial/part-2-becoming-a-testarchitect-power-user/lesson-7-creating-data-driven-tests/creating-a-dummy-data-set)  
To connect a test to an external data source, you must create a dummy data set to provide a crucial link to the file.
9.  [Accessing external data from the test](/testarchitect-tutorial/part-2-becoming-a-testarchitect-power-user/lesson-7-creating-data-driven-tests/accessing-external-data-from-the-test)  
Setting up a data-driven test to accept data from an external text file.
10. [Running the test](/testarchitect-tutorial/part-2-becoming-a-testarchitect-power-user/lesson-7-creating-data-driven-tests/running-the-testo4rCN7g)  
Execute a test with multiple records \(rows\) of data supplied by an external data file.
11. [Using filters](/testarchitect-tutorial/part-2-becoming-a-testarchitect-power-user/lesson-7-creating-data-driven-tests/using-filters)  
You can apply filters to your data set to limit the sets of data applied to your test.
12. [Applying a data filter](/testarchitect-tutorial/part-2-becoming-a-testarchitect-power-user/lesson-7-creating-data-driven-tests/applying-a-data-filter)  
Add a filter to your test to limit the data coming in.
13. [Named filters](/testarchitect-tutorial/part-2-becoming-a-testarchitect-power-user/lesson-7-creating-data-driven-tests/named-filters)  
Named filters are established in a data set and may be referenced in your tests.
