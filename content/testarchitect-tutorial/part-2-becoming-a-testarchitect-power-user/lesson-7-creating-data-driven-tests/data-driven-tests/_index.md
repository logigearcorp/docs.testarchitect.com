Automated test sequences can be run repeatedly using sets of data supplied from a repository source external to the test.

In the following exercise, you will define a data set consisting of eight rows of data. Each row consists of four values relating to aggregate car rentals of a company: the model of car, the month rented, rental location \(state\), and the quantity rented. You will then create a test case that connects to the data set, pulls a row of data from the data set, and finally displays the data in the form of a report action. The test cycles through and repeats the report for each available row of data.
