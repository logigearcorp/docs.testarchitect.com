The exercises in this lesson guide you through the creation of a test that simulates a user logging into the sample application, populating a text field and clicking a button.

**Audience:** Testers, Automation engineers

**Prerequisites:**

-   Basic understanding of the TestArchitect Client user interface
-   Familiarity with the TestArchitect test editor
-   Essential understanding of TestArchitect repositories, projects and tests

**What you will learn:**

-   How to read, create and maintain the interface entities and interface elements of TestArchitect interfaces.
-   Mapping and maintaining interface definitions with the TestArchitectInterface Viewer.
-   Using your interface definitions in a test.

1.  [Interface mapping](/TA_Tutorials/Topics/Interface_mapping_discussion.201401.html)  
Interface definitions in TestArchitect perform the function of interface mapping, which is used to insulate tests from changes to a target application's interface elements.
2.  [Creating interface definitions](/TA_Tutorials/Topics/Creating_interface_definitions.html)  
Create interface definitions to enable a test to interact with an application window.
3.  [Interface Viewer](/TA_Tutorials/Topics/Interface_Viewer.html)  
The Interface Viewer assists in capturing elements of an application interface and generating interface definitions.
4.  [Creating mappings with the Interface Viewer](/TA_Tutorials/Topics/Using_the_Interface_Viewer.html)  
Use the Interface Viewer to create mappings for user interface elements.
5.  [Using interface definitions](/TA_Tutorials/Topics/Using_interface_definitions.html)  
Write and execute a test that makes use of the interface definitions you have created.
