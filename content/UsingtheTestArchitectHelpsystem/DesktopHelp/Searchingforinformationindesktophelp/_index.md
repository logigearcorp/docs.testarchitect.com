# Searching for information in desktop help {#concept_yzx_gvb_cp .concept}

How to search for topics within TestArchitect Help.

In addition to [context-sensitive help](hs_getting_help.md#section.context_sensitive_help), you have several options for locating the information you need in TestArchitect's desktop help system:

-   **Contents** tab: Provides an expandable tree-style view of the documentation's table of contents. Click the plus sign \( + \) next to a node or double-click the node's title to expand or contract the table of contents under that node.
-   **Index** tab: Contains a categorized list of keywords organized alphabetically. To find a term or phrase, scroll through the list or type the desired text into the search box at the top of the page. As you type into the search box, the topics list scrolls to that part of the list that most closely matches your text.

-   **Search** tab: Use this tab to conduct a full-text search for your term or phrase. To find topics containing a specified search term, type the desired text, or search expression, into the box at the top of the page, then press Enter or click the List Topics button. The topics list then displays those topics that most closely match the search expression. Note that your search expression may consist of wildcards, boolean operators and nested expressions to specify more specific search conditions. For more information, see [Full-Text Search](hs_CHM_full_text_search.html).

    **Note:** After finding a topic with **Search**, you can opt to display the TestArchitect Help section to which the topic belongs. This can be very helpful to find related information. Do this by clicking the **Locate** \(![](../Images/btn_locate.png)\) button on the help viewerâ€™s toolbar. This activates the **Contents** tab and highlights the topic in the topics tree, allowing you to see exactly where the topic is situated within the documentation. \(Please note that some topics that may be encountered by means of **Search** are not included in the table of contents; hence **Locate** has no effect. Also note that using **Locate** from the **Index** or **Favorites** tabs is not supported.\)

-   **Favorites** tab: Use this tab to maintain your own personal collection of frequently-visited topics. While you are viewing a help topic, you can choose to add it to your **Favorites** list by clicking the **Favorites** tab and then clicking the **Add** button at the bottom of the window.
