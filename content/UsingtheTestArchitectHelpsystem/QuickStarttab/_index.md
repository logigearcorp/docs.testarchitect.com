# Quick Start tab {#getting_started_quick_start .concept}

The **Quick Start** tab, which appears when you open TestArchitect Client, and remains available until you close it, offers quick access to some of the most common features of the client, along with helpful information.

Among other things, **Quick Start** lets you conveniently connect to a repository, create a new project, record actions, and open step-by-step tutorials.

**Note:** The **Quick Start** tab appears, by default, every time TestArchitect is launched. The option to suppress or permit this appearance may be set in the Preferences dialog box. \([Learn more](Additional_features_preferences.html).\)
