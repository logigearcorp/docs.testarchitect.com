# Getting Help {#concept_wp5_gqb_cp .concept}

How to access the TestArchitect Help system, and how to activate context-specific help on dialog boxes, built-in actions, and TestArchitect explorer tree items.

## Using local help documentation in offline mode { .section}

Since TestArchitect version [8.3 Update 2](../../TA_ReleaseNotes/DITA_source/Whats_New_8.3_update_2.html), the TestArchitect Help package has been totally removed from TestArchitect installer. Therefore, if you'd like to continue to open local help documentation in [offline mode](../../TA_Help/Topics/Additional_features_preferences.md#li.Use_online_help), follow the below options.

-   For Windows: [Learn more](hs_local_help_Windows.html).
-   For Linux and macOS: [Learn more](hs_local_help_linux_macOS.html).

## Displaying TestArchitect Help { .section}

TestArchitect Help may be invoked by doing any one of the following:

-   Selecting **Help** \> **TestArchitect Help** from the TestArchitect main menu.
-   Clicking the **TestArchitect Help** \(![](../Images/btn_help.png)\) button on the right of the TestArchitect toolbar.

## Accessing context-specific TestArchitect Help {#section.context_sensitive_help .section}

In addition to the general Help system, TestArchitect offers various shortcuts to let you get to the specific Help page of your current area of interest:

## Dialog boxes { .section}

Help is available for most of the dialog boxes that appear in TestArchitect. Generally, one or more of the following options are available to invoke Help on an open dialog box:

-   Press F1.
-   Click the **Learn more...** link.
-   Click the **Help** ![](../Images/btn_help_dlg.png) button.

## Built-in actions, built-in settings { .section}

TestArchitect comes packaged with hundreds of [built-in actions](../../TA_Automation/Topics/bia_Built_in_actions.html) and [built-in settings](../../TA_Automation/Topics/bis_Built_in_settings.html) that form the core components of your tests. The Help system provides a reference page for each built-in action, and built-in setting which includes a description of the action's purpose, the arguments that it accepts, the contexts in which it can be applied, and examples of its use. From within the test editor, after entering an action's name, or setting's name you can invoke its reference page by doing the following:

1.  Place the cell pointer in the cell containing the action, or setting's name.
2.  Press F1.

## Project items \(in the TestArchitect explorer tree\) { .section}

The TestArchitect explorer tree displays nodes for various types of items, such as projects and project items \(test modules, interfaces, etc.\), tools and administrative nodes. More information on a given type of node may be obtained by selecting it in the explorer tree, then doing any one of the following:

-   Selecting **Help** \> **TestArchitect Help** from the TestArchitect main menu.
-   Clicking the **TestArchitect Help** \(![](../Images/btn_help.png)\) button on the right of the TestArchitect toolbar.
-   Pressing F1.
