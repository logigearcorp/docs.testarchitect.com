This section describes procedures for stopping the repository server.

1.  In the Repository Server Control Panel, if the repository server is running, the status message at lower left reads, The repository server is started, and the **Stop** ![](/images/TA_Administration/Images/btn.RS_stop_repo.png) button is enabled. Click the **Stop** button to stop the repository server.
