From 8.5 Update 1 onward, all versions of TestArchitect Client 8.5 and Repository Server 8.5 will be compatible with each other.

The backward compatibility diagram:

**For example:**

TestArchitect Client 8.5.6 will work smoothly with a Repository Server running 8.5.1.

However, if you were to big upgrade to 8.6 you would need to uprgrade both the Repository Server and TestArchitect Client.
