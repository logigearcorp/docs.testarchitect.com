Designating the **Assigned user** for a project item.

Ensure the following requirements are met:

-   You are logged in to a repository as a member of the administrators, test managers, automation leads, or test leads group. \(See [User administration](User_administration.html) for details.\)
-   If your account belongs to the test managers, automation leads, or test leads group, you must have been assigned to the project you are working on. \(See [Assigning projects and permissions to a repository user](User_administration.html) for details.\)

Any project item may have up to one user assigned to it, or it may remain unassigned.

**Note:** **Assigned user** status has its greatest impact on members of the [testers group](/TA_Help/Topics/Projects_assign_user.html). A testers member is restricted from modifying any project items other than those that are either assigned to him or herself, or are unassigned.

To assign a TestArchitect user to a specific project item, do the following:

1.  In the TestArchitect explorer tree, double-click the project item node to which you want to assign a TestArchitect user.

2.  Select the **Information** tab.

3.  In the **Assign user** box, select a user to assign to this project item.

    **Tip:** If you'd like to assign this item to no one, just select the \(not assigned\) option.
