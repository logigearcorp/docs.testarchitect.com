As an administrator, you can change the password of a user. This is especially helpful if a user forgets his or her password.

To change a user's password, do the following:

1.  Invoke the [Manage Users](/reuse/../TA_Administration/Topics/adm_users_invoking_Manage_Users.html) Manager Users dialog box for a given repository. \(You can do this by right-clicking the **Administration** node and then selecting **Manage Users**.\)

2.  In the Users panel, select the user.

3.  Select the **Profile** tab and then click **Change Password**.
