After creating an encrypted password, you can edit it.

Only members of the administrators and test managers groups have privileges for accessing password management.

1.  Log into a project as a user with an administrator or test manager role. \(See [User administration](/TA_Administration/Topics/User_administration.html) for details\).

2.  Right-click the project and select **Manage Passwords**.

3.  In the Manage Passwords dialog box, select the password that you want to modify by clicking the **Edit password** button ![](/images/TA_Administration/Images/Edit_password_btn.png).

4.  Enter a new password.

5.  Click **Apply**.
