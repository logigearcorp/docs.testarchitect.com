TestArchitect's support for LDAP \(Lightweight Directory Access Protocol\) allows your TestArchitect login credentials to be established through your system account, avoiding the need for a separate sign on.

TestArchitect currently supports Microsoft Active Directory service to provide LDAP functionality. With a properly configured client, this allows LDAP's single sign-on to be available to you, whether your system runs on Windows, Linux, or macOS. \(Refer to [LDAP overview](/user-guide/integration-with-third-party-tools/ldap-overview/) for details.\)
