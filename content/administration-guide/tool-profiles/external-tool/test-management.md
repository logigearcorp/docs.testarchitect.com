Integration solutions are available for various third-party test management systems, offering you the option to harness the full potential of TestArchitect along with other systems to best meet your organization's particular needs.

Currently, TestArchitect supports integration with the following test management tools:

-   [HP Quality Center](/user-guide/integration-with-third-party-tools/hp-quality-center/configuring-integration-with-hp-quality-center/setting-up-the-connection-with-quality-center/configuring-the-quality-center-connection)
-   [Team Foundation Server-Microsoft Team Foundation](/user-guide/integration-with-third-party-tools/tfs-integration/on-premises-tfs-environment-configuration/authoring-test-procedures-under-on-premises-tfs/configuring-ta-for-a-tfs-connection)

{{<caution>}}

As a general rule, only one test management tool can be active at any given time in TestArchitect. Activating the Quality Center external tool, for example, automatically deactivates the Team Foundation Server tool.
