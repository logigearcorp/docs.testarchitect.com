Using **Tool Profiles**, you can configure TestArchitect to support integration with external third-party tools. In addition, its support for LDAP \(Lightweight Directory Access Protocol\) allows your TestArchitect login credentials to be established through your system account, avoiding the need for a separate sign on. Finally, **Tool Profiles** includes several predefined harnesses, which are scripts or programs that interpret and execute the action lines of a test sequence.

{{<remember>}} You must be logged in to TestArchitect Client as a member of the [administrator](/administration-guide/users-and-passwords/user-administration/) group to configure external tools, or create or edit test tool profiles. Administrator changes are made available to all other clients logging in to the same repository.

2.  [LDAP Tool](/administration-guide/tool-profiles/ldap-tool)  
TestArchitect's support for LDAP \(Lightweight Directory Access Protocol\) allows your TestArchitect login credentials to be established through your system account, avoiding the need for a separate sign on.
3.  [Test Tool](/administration-guide/tool-profiles/test-tool/)  
The **Test Tool** node of the TestArchitect explorer tree provides several predefined harnesses, which are scripts or programs that interpret and execute the action lines of a test sequence. It also offers you the option of configuring your own harness, one designed for the programming language of your choice.
