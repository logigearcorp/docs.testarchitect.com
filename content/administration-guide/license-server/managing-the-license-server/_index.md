How to start and stop the license server, change the server port, and create a redundant license server.

1.  [Starting and stopping the server](../../TA_Administration/Topics/LS_TA_managing_start_stop.md)  
The license server can be started and stopped from the License Server Control Panel.
2.  [Changing the license server port number](../../TA_Administration/Topics/LS_TA_managing_changing_port.md)  
You can change the connection port on which a license server listens and grants license connection requests.
3.  [Creating a redundant license server](../../TA_Administration/Topics/LS_TA_managing_creating_redundant_license.md)  
A redundant license server can be set up as a backup for an existing license server. When your primary license server goes down, the redundant license server is automatically and seamlessly activated.
4.  [Unblocking a redundant license server](../../TA_Administration/Topics/adm_unblocking_redundant_license_server.md)  
After a 72-hour period of continuous operation following the failure or absence of a primary license server, a redundant license server blocks further requests for licenses. If your primary server remains unavailable, send an activation key request to LogiGear for an extension of the redundant server's operation.
