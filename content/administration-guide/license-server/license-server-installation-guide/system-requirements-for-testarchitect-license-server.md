{{<note>}} To host License Server, you'll need either a valid FQDN \([fully-qualified domain name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fully_qualified_domain_name)\) to get a 99-year license key, or a static IP address to get one-year license key and annual renewal keys after that. Please ensure that you have this information at hand because you'll need it in order to [request license key](/administration-guide/license-server/obtaining-a-testarchitect-license/requesting-a-license-key#).
