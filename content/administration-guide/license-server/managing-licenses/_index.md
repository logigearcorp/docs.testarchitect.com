The processes of license conversion, reclaiming, redirecting, and removing.

1.  [TestArchitect editions](/administration-guide/license-server/managing-licenses/testarchitect-editions)  
TestArchitect Team, and TestArchitect Enterprise editions of TestArchitect offer a range of capabilities tailored to meet the needs of your organization.
2.  [Viewing license information](/administration-guide/license-server/managing-licenses/viewing-license-information)  
You can access current TestArchitect Client licensing information from the TestArchitect Client **Help** menu.
3.  [License conversion](/administration-guide/license-server/managing-licenses/license-conversion/)  
With floating licenses, TestArchitect Client licenses can be shared by multiple users within the same organization on a non-concurrent basis.
4.  [Node-locked licenses](/administration-guide/license-server/managing-licenses/node-locked-licenses/)  
A node-locked license is tied to a specific machine for a certain period of time, but, within some constraints, may be reassigned.
5.  [Upgrading node-locked into floating license keys](/administration-guide/license-server/managing-licenses/upgrading-node-locked-into-floating-license-keys)  
Node locked license keys by convention are not convertible into floating license keys. However, it is possible to upgrade node-locked into floating license keys, when you request a new upgrade key from LogiGear sales representative.
6.  [Reclaiming a floating license from a host](/administration-guide/license-server/managing-licenses/reclaiming-a-floating-license-from-a-host)  
It may sometimes be necessary to reclaim a floating license from a host and return the license to the license pool.
7.  [Transferring host-based licenses](/administration-guide/license-server/managing-licenses/transferring-host-based-licenses)  
A license dedicated to a particular host can be reassigned to a different host as needed.
8.  [Removing licenses](/administration-guide/license-server/managing-licenses/removing-licenses)  
Floating \(Universal\), Node-Locked, and Floating Agent licenses can be removed from the license server. This is useful for clearing out expired licenses key or remove all the licenses added by credential information.
