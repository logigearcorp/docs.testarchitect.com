A node-locked license is tied to a specific machine for a certain period of time, but, within some constraints, may be reassigned.

A node-locked license is one that is granted to a specific machine. During a set period of time after assignment, the license is locked into that machine â€“ that is, it cannot be reassigned, whether or not the assignee is using it, and regardless of the demand for it by others.

Unlike a dedicated host-based license, a machine with a node-locked license has Universal license usage rights \([learn more](/TA_Administration/Topics/TA_Editions.html)\), as determined by the type of license purchased.

Assigning a node-locked license binds that license to a machine for a given period of time.
2.  [Transferring a node-locked machine license](/TA_Administration/Topics/LS_TA_changing_node-locked_machine.html)  
Within certain limits, you are free to transfer a node-locked license from one machine to another, as you might wish to do when upgrading to a new test machine.
