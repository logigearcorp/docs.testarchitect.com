With floating licenses, TestArchitect Client licenses can be shared by multiple users within the same organization on a non-concurrent basis.Any floating license can be reconfigured to act as a host-based license, thereby restricting the availability of that license to one specific machine. This process is reversible: any host-based license can be converted back to a floating license. However, note that, the node-locked license is locked onto one machine and cannot be converted to another type.

{{<remember>}} An Agent license remains an Agent license whether it is converted from floating tohost-based, or vice versa. The same is true for Universal.
