Within a working session, you can obtain a temporary Universal license to enable all features available in TestArchitect.

To temporarily acquire an Universal license:

1.  On the TestArchitect Client toolbar, select **Help** \> **License Server** \> **Upgrade License**.

{{<note>}} The **Upgrade License** option is disabled if your copy of TestArchitect already has an Universal license.

    A dialog box appears, letting you know whether the license acquisition was successful.


TestArchitect acquires a temporary Universal license for the current working session, if one is available. After you close the current session, the acquired Universal license is released and TestArchitect is reassigned the license it previously had.
