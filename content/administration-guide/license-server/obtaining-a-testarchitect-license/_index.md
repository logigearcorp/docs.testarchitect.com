Obtaining a TestArchitect license, or adding a license, is a two-step process which involves submitting a request to LogiGear for a license key and using the authorized key to add the license.

1.  [Requesting a license key](../../TA_Administration/Topics/LS_TA_requesting_key.md)  
License keys may be requested from your TestArchitect or LogiGear sales representative using the Request TestArchitect Licenses dialog box.
2.  [Adding new licenses](../../TA_Administration/Topics/LS_TA_adding_new_license.md)  
New license keys received from the LogiGear sales team may be added to your license server from the License Server Control Panel.
