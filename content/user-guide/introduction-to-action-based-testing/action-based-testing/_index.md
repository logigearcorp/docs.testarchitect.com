Action Based Testing is an example of a keyword-based methodology, as described previously.

Action Based Testing is based on test module elements, which are essentially workbooks comprising the following sections:

-   objectives
-   test cases
-   actions with arguments
-   interface handling, including:
    -   interfaces
    -   interface entities
    -   interface elements
-   data-driven testing, using data sets

1.  [Test Modules](/user-guide/introduction-to-action-based-testing/action-based-testing/test-modules)  
All test development and execution in Action Based Testing is based on test modules.
2.  [Actions](/user-guide/introduction-to-action-based-testing/action-based-testing/actions)  
An action is a reusable container housing a series of operations and checks.
3.  [Interface definitions](/user-guide/introduction-to-action-based-testing/action-based-testing/interface-definitions)  
An automated test execution needs to interact with the application under test through one or more interfaces.
4.  [Data-driven testing](/user-guide/introduction-to-action-based-testing/action-based-testing/data-driven-testing)  
In Action Based Testing, action-based tests can be applied to data sets.
