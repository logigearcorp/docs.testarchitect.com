Sometimes you may want to disable a breakpoint without doing away with it entirely. Execution is not paused when it meets a disabled breakpoint. The breakpoint remains marked in the margin for your reference, and can be re-enabled when again needed.

To disable the currently selected breakpoint, follow these steps:

1.  Right-click the row header that contains the breakpoint.

2.  Select **Debug** \> **Disable Breakpoint**.

    {{<tip>}} If you want to deactivate all your breakpoints, select **Execution** \> **Debug** \> **Skip all** from the main menu.
