If you no longer need a breakpoint, delete it.

1.  Select an action line that contains the breakpoint.

2.  Do one of the following:

    -   Double-click the row header.
    -   Right-click the selected action line, then select **Debug** \> **Toggle Breakpoint**.
{{<note>}} You also can remove all of your existing breakpoints by selecting **Execution** \> **Debug** \> **Remove all** from the main menu.


After you have removed the breakpoint, the red breakpoint indicator dot next to the row number disappears.
