You can edit the startup attributes of existing user-defined and built-in settings.

From TestArchitect Client, you can modify the startup settings for [client-directed test runs](/user-guide/support/glossary-of-terms/client-directed-execution) as well as batch files. The values of the **Value** and **Description** fields of a startup setting can be edited in the Execute Test dialog box. For a user-defined startup setting, the **Name** field may also be changed.

To modify a startup setting for a user-defined or built-in setting, do the following:

1.  Launch the [Execute Test](/user-guide/test-execution/methods-of-test-execution/configuring-and-running-tests-from-testarchitect-client) dialog box.

2.  Select the **Startup Settings** tab.

3.  From the Startup Settings panel, select a setting you would like to modify, and then click **Edit**.

4.  In the dialog box, edit the **Value**, or **Description** fields as desired. For a user-defined setting, the **Name** field may also be modified.

5.  Click **OK**.


The attributes of the setting are updated based on your changes.
