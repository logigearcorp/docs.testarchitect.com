Every project item with variations must also have a default, or base, variation.

Any given variation of a project item \(specifically, of a test module, action, interface, or data set\) is distinguished from other variations of that same project item by its combination of keywords and versionsthe unique set of keywords attached to it. For every project item, there is always one variation that has no associated keywordsor versions. This is known as the default variation. As we shall see, the reason for the term default is that this is always the variation of last resort: when TestArchitect needs to execute some action, and no other variation of that action satisfies its requirements, the default variation is the one it always falls back on.
