Rules for creating variations.

1.  [Linking to one system](/user-guide/variations/rules-for-creating-variations/linking-to-one-system)  
Each variation of a given project item definition must be linked to the same system, or to no system at all.
2.  [Linking to multiple versions](/user-guide/variations/rules-for-creating-variations/linking-to-multiple-versions)  
A variation may be linked to only one system. However, that variation may be linked to multiple version nodes belonging to a single system.
3.  [Assigning a keyword signature to a variation](/user-guide/variations/rules-for-creating-variations/assigning-a-keyword-signature-to-a-variation)  
A given variation is identified by its variation signature: the combination of the system versions it is linked to \(system signature\) and the keywords assigned to it \(keyword signature\). This topic discusses the keyword signature.
4.  [Uniqueness of effective variations](/user-guide/variations/rules-for-creating-variations/uniqueness-of-effective-variations)  
For each effective variation of a given project item, the combination of version signature and keyword signature must be unique. TestArchitect enforces that uniqueness when you create new variations.
