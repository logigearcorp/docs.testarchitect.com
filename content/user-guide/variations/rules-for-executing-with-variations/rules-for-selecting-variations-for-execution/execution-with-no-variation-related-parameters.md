If, at the start of execution, both fields \(**Keyword** and **AUT Version**\) of the Variation Specification section are left blank, then the default variation of an invoked test module, action, interface, or data set constitutes an exact match, and is invoked.

Every action, interface, or data set has a default variation which is, by definition, the variation with no keywords or version nodes attached to it.
