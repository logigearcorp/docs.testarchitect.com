At execution setup, you have the option of specifying a version variation for each defined system in your repository's **Systems & Platforms** tree.

Note that you are free to specify or to omit versions for any of the systems in **Systems & Platforms**. Also note that you may specify no more than a single version for any given system.

Specify your version run set in the **AUT Version** field of the **Variation Specification** panel of the Execute Test dialog box. Optionally, you may invoke the Select Version dialog box, which displays the **Systems & Platforms** tree and allows you to select up to a single node from each system.
