This section describes concepts of TestArchitect's Dashboard and shows you how to use the Dashboard to support your testing tasks, track progress and display results.

1.  [Introduction](/TA_Help/Topics/Dashboard_intro.html)  
The TestArchitect Dashboard is a webâ€“based application that connects directly to a TestArchitect repository and receives project information from it. This information can be presented as customizable graphs, charts, indicators, and reports to help you analyze and manage test projects.
2.  [Starting the Dashboard](/TA_Help/Topics/Dashboard_starting.html)  
A Dashboard instance is accessible from TestArchitect Client, TestArchitect Lab Manager, or a browser.
3.  [Dashboard pages](/TA_Help/Topics/Dashboard_pages.html)  
A Dashboard page acts as a container for one or more panels, arranged in columns, that display metrics about your tests and test projects.
4.  [Dashboard panels](/TA_Help/Topics/Dashboard_panels.html)  
Panels are the primary means of presenting project information on the Dashboard. They show data retrieved from underlying data profiles known as report profiles in TestArchitect Client.
5.  [Data profiles](/TA_Help/Topics/Dashboard_data_profiles.html)  
Similar to the report profile found in TestArchitect Client, a data profile for a dashboard panel is a set of customized data. In fact, report profiles defined in TestArchitect Client may be used as data profiles for Dashboard panels, and vice versa.
6.  [Category and series](/TA_Help/Topics/Dashboard_category_series.html)  
A panel's **Category** and **Series** settings determine which data are displayed on the chart, and how they are presented.
7.  [Dashboard permissions](/TA_Help/Topics/Dashboard_authentication_permissions.html)  
The ability to add, modify and delete items in a Dashboard session depends on the credentials of the logged-in user.
8.  [Lesson \#9: Creating Dashboard chartsDashboard tutorials](/TA_Help/Topics/Dashboard_tutorials.html)  
These tutorials show you how to create new charts and how to modify the chart to display different types of data.
