    1.  Open the TestArchitect Repository Server - Control Panel by double-clicking on the TestArchitect Repository Server icon on Windowsâ€™ notification area.

    2.  On the TestArchitect Repository Server - Control Panel main menu, select **Tools** \> **TestArchitect Utility Server Information**.

        The server information window opens:

The logon credential used to log on to the Lab Manager session is also used to log on to the Dashboard instance. A Dashboard page appears displaying the saved panels. Depending on your user permission level, you can add, modify, and delete panels on the Dashboard.
