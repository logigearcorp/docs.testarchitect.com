        **Note:** The TestArchitect Utility Server Information command is enabled only after the Repository Server has been started.

        The server information window opens:

The logon credential used to log on to the Lab Manager session is also used to log on to the Dashboard instance. A Dashboard page appears displaying the saved panels. Depending on your user permission level, you can add, modify, and delete panels on the Dashboard.
