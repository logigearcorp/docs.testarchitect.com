Updating a panel refreshes the panel with the latest filtering data from the data profile.

Ensure that you are logged in to the Dashboard session containing the panel you want to update.

To update a Dashboard panel with the latest data profile:

1.  On the panel you want to get the latest data profile for, point to the ![](/images/TA_Help/Images/Dashboard_panels_more_icon.png) icon and select **Get latest**.

2.  If the logged-in user is the owner of the panel being updated, a Save Filters dialog box appears asking if you want to save the changed filters. Select an appropriate choice \(explained below\) and click **OK**.

    -   **Yes, permanently save the changed filters for this panel**: Apply the latest filters and update the queried data based on the new filters for this panel. All changes are saved permanently. Modified filters are not lost after this panel is closed or the current session has expired.
    -   **No, just keep the changed filters for this panel in the current session**: Apply the latest filters and update the queried data based on the new filters for this panel. The changes are discarded after this panel is closed or the current session expires.

The displayed panel is updated in accordance with the latest data from the data profile.
