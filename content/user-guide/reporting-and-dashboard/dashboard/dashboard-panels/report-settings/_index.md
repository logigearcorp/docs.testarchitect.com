A report displays detailed information on the progress of a test and gives insight into the test runs and their results.

A Dashboard panel report is composed of four sections:

-   **Header**: Displays general report information such as a project's name, date, and folder location.
-   **Report detail**: Click on the **expand** icon \(\[+\]\) next to the **REPORT DETAIL** to display a table containing detailed report information. The contents of the table depend on the test results and the report data profile. Expanded items may contain hyperlinks to corresponding entities in TestArchitect. The table below is an example of a status report.
