Modifying a report's appearance and/or the data used to generate it.

To edit the properties of a report panel on the Dashboard page:

1.  [Launch an instance of the Dashboard](/user-guide/reporting-and-dashboard/dashboard/starting-the-dashboard/) and log in to the session as a user with [permission](/user-guide/reporting-and-dashboard/dashboard/dashboard-permissions) sufficient to edit a report panel.

2.  On the Dashboard, go to the Dashboard page containing the report panel you want to edit and click **Edit Panel** ![](/images/TA_Help/Images/Dashboard_edit_panel_icon.png).

3.  On the Edit Panel dialog box, change the panel settings on the **Display Settings** and **Filters** tabs as needed.

    The panel settings on the Edit Panel dialog box are the same as the settings on the Add New Panel dialog box for reports \(see [Create new indicator panel](/user-guide/reporting-and-dashboard/dashboard/dashboard-panels/report-settings/creating-a-new-report-panel)\) steps \#[3](/user-guide/reporting-and-dashboard/dashboard/dashboard-panels/report-settings/creating-a-new-report-panel#step_pde7_cy3e) through \#[4](/user-guide/reporting-and-dashboard/dashboard/dashboard-panels/report-settings/creating-a-new-report-panel#step_dk38_8sdf) with the following additional setting options:

    -   Height: Set the height \(in pixels\) of the panel. Taller panels have higher resolution, producing sharper charts.
    -   Folder: Select a TestArchitect repository folder containing the report data you want displayed in the new panel.
4.  After adding customized filters to the panel, if you want to save the new filtering expression\(s\) to a new data profile, click **Save as** on the **Filters** tab and enter the name of the data profile on the **Save setting profile as** text box, then click **Save**.

    ![](/images/TA_Help/Images/Dashboard_save_setting_profile_as.png)

    The Dashboard creates a new data profile based on the profile specified in the **Data Profile** drop-down list \(on the **Display Settings** tab\) with customized filters added. The logged-in user owns the newly created data profile, and this Dashboard panel uses this new profile.

5.  After adding customized filters to the panel, if you want to save the new filtering expression\(s\) to a new data profile, click **Save as** on the **Filters** tab and enter the name of the data profile on the **Save setting profile as** text box, then click **Save**.

    ![](/images/TA_Help/Images/Dashboard_save_setting_profile_as.png)

    The Dashboard creates a new data profile based on the profile specified in the **Data Profile** drop-down list \(on the **Display Settings** tab\) with customized filters added. The logged-in user owns the newly created data profile, and this Dashboard panel uses this new profile.

6.  Click **OK** to save the new panel settings.
