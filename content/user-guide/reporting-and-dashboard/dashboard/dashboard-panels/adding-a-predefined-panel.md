TestArchitect has a wide range of predefined panels that you can choose from to present data from your project.

To add a predefined panel to a Dashboard page:

1.  [Launch an instance of the Dashboard](/user-guide/reporting-and-dashboard/dashboard/starting-the-dashboard/) and log in to the session as a user with [permission](/user-guide/reporting-and-dashboard/dashboard/dashboard-permissions) higher than that of the guest user.

2.  On the page selection tool bar, click **Choose Panels**.

    The panels on the current page slide down to reveal the list of predefined panels.

3.  Select a predefined panel from the list.

4.  On the Panel Configuration dialog box, enter the information as requested and click **OK**.

    -   Select page: Select the page in which the newly added panel will appear.
    -   Height: Set the height \(in pixels\) of the panel. Taller panels have higher resolution, producing sharper charts.
    -   Folder: Select a TestArchitect repository folder containing the report data you want displayed in the new panel.

You can add more panels to the Dashboard page or customize the panel settings as needed.
