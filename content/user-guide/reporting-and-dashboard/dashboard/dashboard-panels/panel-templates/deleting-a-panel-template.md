Deleting a panel template removes that template from the list of available templates.

To delete a panel template on the Dashboard page:

1.  [Launch an instance of the Dashboard](/user-guide/reporting-and-dashboard/dashboard/starting-the-dashboard/) and log in to the session as a user with [permission](/user-guide/reporting-and-dashboard/dashboard/dashboard-permissions) sufficient to delete a panel template.

2.  On the Dashboard administrative bar, point to **Administer** and select **Panels**.

    The Dashboard's displays a table list of panel names for the logon repository.

3.  On the panel name table list, select the panel\(s\) you want to delete and click **Delete** on top of the table. Alternatively, you can click the **Delete** button under the **Action** column of the panel name row you want to delete.

    {{<tip>}} Only the panel names in which the logon user has [permission](/user-guide/reporting-and-dashboard/dashboard/dashboard-permissions) to delete have the **Delete** buttons and the panel's name check boxes enabled.


All panels instantiated from the deleted panel template are unaffected by the removal of the template panel.
