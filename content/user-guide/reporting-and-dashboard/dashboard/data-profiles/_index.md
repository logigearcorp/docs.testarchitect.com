Similar to the report profile found in TestArchitect Client, a data profile for a dashboard panel is a set of customized data. In fact, report profiles defined in TestArchitect Client may be used as data profiles for Dashboard panels, and vice versa.

In a data profile, you specify which items \(like test modules, actions, results, etc.\) the data are gathered from, what fields of those items to include and how to organize them into presentable information, by means of filtering, sorting, grouping and/or calculation of statistics. This information defined in the data profile can then be presented in one or more panels, where you specify whether to display it as a chart, indicator, report or heat map.
