TestArchitect's dashboard tool allows you to create a wide range of reports and provides you with the dashboard tool to help you manage and monitor your projects.

In addition to test run results, TestArchitect can produce reports on various aspects of your test project. You can use predefined sets of reports to cover most common situations, or you can customize your own reports and save the settings for later use.
