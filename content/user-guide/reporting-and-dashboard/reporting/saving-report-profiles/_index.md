After setting up a customized report, you may want to save the settings you have created so that future reports with those same settings can be readily generated. TestArchitect makes this possible with report profiles.

After [creating a report profile](/TA_Help/Topics/Report_producing.html) in the **Edit Profile** panel, you can save it for future use.

1.  On the **Edit Profile** panel in the main window, click the **Keep as** button.

    The Save setting profile as dialog box appears.

2.  Enter a profile name, and then click **Save**.


The title of the saved profile is added as an entry in the **Profile name** drop-down list. The profile also appears as an option in the **Reporting** \> **Create Reports** submenu of each node, enabling reporting of the saved profile from the TestArchitect explorer tree.

**Tip:** If you make changes after you save a profile, click the **Update** button to save your updated settings to the current profile.
