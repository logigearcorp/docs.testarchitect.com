With TestArchitect's powerful reporting features, customized reports can be generated to show current and historical data based on the various criteria that you specify. You can readily show the progress of test development, test run performance and result trends, and a host of other aspects of a project.

1.  [Creating reports](/user-guide/reporting-and-dashboard/reporting/creating-reports)  
Reports can be produced for entire projects or for specified project items.
2.  [Customizing reports](/user-guide/reporting-and-dashboard/reporting/customizing-reports)  
TestArchitectoffers a wealth of features to allow you to create reports on your projects and tests, and customize those reports to meet your unique needs.
3.  [Saving report profiles](/user-guide/reporting-and-dashboard/reporting/saving-report-profiles)  
After setting up a customized report, you may want to save the settings you have created so that future reports with those same settings can be readily generated. TestArchitect makes this possible with report profiles.
4.  [Deleting custom report profiles](/user-guide/reporting-and-dashboard/reporting/deleting-custom-report-profiles)  
Deleting a saved report profile removes the profile from the **Reporting** context menu and the **Report Profile** list.
