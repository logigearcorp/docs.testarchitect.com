The following new features and improvements are introduced in TestArchitect version 8.2 Update 2 running under Windows.

**Remember:**

-   Before upgrading to the latest version of TestArchitect, it is strongly recommended that you back up all repositories.
-   A TestArchitect client and any repository server to which it connects must be of the same version.

## TestArchitect Client

-   [**Visual Studio Team Services beta support**](/TA_Help/Topics/ug_MTM_supported_platforms.html):
    -   Both on-premise and cloud-based Team Foundation Server 2015 are now supported for integration with TestArchitect, along with Microsoft’s on-premise and cloud-based Test Agent and Test Controller version 2013 update 5.
    -   [Basic authentication access](/TA_Help/Topics/Integration_MTM_map_proj.html) methods to Visual Studio Team Services \(Visual Studio Online\) — Alternate Authentication Credentials and Personal Access Tokens — are supported. Note that authentication access with OAth protocol is currently not supported.

## TestArchitect Automation

-   **[Point-to-identify](/TA_Automation/Topics/aut_app_testing_mobile_web_Chrome_identifying_controls.html) is now available for controls on Android Chrome:** Enhancements to Device Live Screen now allow for the Interface Viewer’s **Identification** tool to be used to identify and map UI controls in web applications running on Google Chrome on Android devices.
-   **Support for mobile web automation on [Safari](/TA_Automation/Topics/aut_app_testing_mobile_web_Safari.html) running on iOS 9.0.x**.
