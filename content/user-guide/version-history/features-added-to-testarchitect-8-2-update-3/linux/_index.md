The following new features and improvements are introduced in TestArchitect version 8.2 Update 3 running under Linux.

**Remember:**

-   Before upgrading to the latest version of TestArchitect, it is strongly recommended that you back up all repositories.
-   A TestArchitect client and any repository server to which it connects must be of the same version.

## TestArchitect Client

**Enhancements to existing features**

-   Performance improvement during startup of the Repository Server.

## TestArchitect Automation

-   **Built-in actions/built-in setting to handle unpredicted appearance of a modal dialog box in desktop applications**: The troublesome modal dialog can be automatically closed, or custom-handled by a user-defined action.
    -   [on modal action](/TA_Automation/Topics/bia_on_modal_action.html) \(built-in action\): Specify the action to be invoked in the event of the occurrence of a modal dialog box that may block the test automation.
    -   [get modal definition](/TA_Automation/Topics/bia_get_modal_definition.html) \(built-in action\): Retrieve the definition of the current modal dialog box.
    -   [modal close attempts](/TA_Automation/Topics/bis_modal_close_attempts.html) \(built-in setting\): Set the number of retries for the invoked action handler specified in the [on modal action](/TA_Automation/Topics/bia_on_modal_action.html) built-in action.
