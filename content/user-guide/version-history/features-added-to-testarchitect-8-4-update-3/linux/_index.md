The following new features and improvements are introduced in TestArchitect version 8.4 Update 3 running under Linux

**Remember:**

-   Before upgrading to the latest version of TestArchitect, it is strongly recommended that you back up all repositories.
-   A TestArchitect client and any repository server to which it connects must be the same version.

## TestArchitect Client

**New features**

-   The TestArchitect command line tool is supplemented with one more command named [export](/TA_Help/Topics/TA_command_line_export.html) which allows users to export TestArchitect items like repository, project, built-in actions, test modules/test cases using the command interface.
-   **Loading mechanism of a test module is changed**. When you open a test module, the Results tab is not loaded until you switch to it. So the loading time of the test module is reduced.
-   When you open a test result, the tree node does not automatically expand and focus the result for faster loading time. The Summary tab of the test results features the [**locate in result tree node**](/TA_Help/Topics/Test_result_summaries.html) button.
-   **[Mapping TestArchitect \(TA\) test modules to Zephyr test cases](/TA_Help/Topics/Zephyr_mapping_TM.html)** â€“ Previously, you could only create mapping between TA test cases and Zephyr counterparts. From 8.4 Update 3 onwards, you can also link a TA test module to a Zephyr test case via two ways:
    -   Via test module list view.
    -   Via the Information tab of a test module.

**Enhancements to existing features**

**Zephyr 6.2 is fully supported**. The import and upload processes from/to Zephyr experience profound changes. From now on, only test steps, rather than all contents, in test modules are uploaded to Zephyr. New options are available in both processes:

-   **Keep folder structure** option - allows you to organize the tests in Zephyr in a similar folder structure to those in TestArchitect and vice versa.
-   **Scan project for existing tests** option - helps eliminate test duplication on Zephyr by not only examining the existing test in the target test folder but also in the whole project.
-   **Create folder corresponding to test module** option - creates a test folder in Zephyr corresponding to each TA test module.

## TestArchitect Automation

**Enhancements to existing features**

-   **Support for multiple test runs on [Generic WebDriver](/TA_Automation/Topics/Generic_WebDriver.html)** - WebDriver can work on multiple instances at once. So it provides the capability to test more than one web page simultaneously.

## Repository Server

-   [**Garbage collector**](/TA_Administration/Topics/Repo_server_management_control_panel.html) is introduced in order to improve the performance of repositories.
