{{<remember>}}

-   Before upgrading to the latest version of TestArchitect, it is strongly recommended that you back up all repositories.
-   A TestArchitect client and any repository server to which it connects must be of the same version.
-   When installing TestArchitect, make sure that both the components TestArchitect Client and Repository Server are selected; this is essential to ensuring that the Interface Viewer can detect Silverlight controls.
