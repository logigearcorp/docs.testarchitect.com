The following new features and improvements are introduced in TestArchitect version 8.2 Update 4 running under Windows.

**Remember:**

-   Before upgrading to the latest version of TestArchitect, it is strongly recommended that you back up all repositories.
-   A TestArchitect client and any repository server to which it connects must be of the same version.

## TestArchitect Client

-   [**Support for \| symbol to separate keywords in variation identifiers:**](/TA_Help/Topics/Variations_create_keyword.html) Streamlines the process of creating multiple variations for a given keyword-defined attribute, such as Browser.

    Previously, each comma-delimited term within the keyword portion of a variation signature was limited to a single keyword. Now, each term, or "keyterm", may consist of multiple keywords OR'd together, for example, login \{Chrome \| Firefox\}. TestArchitect factors such variations into multiple "effective variations".
