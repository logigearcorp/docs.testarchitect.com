The following new features and improvements are introduced in TestArchitect version 8.2 Update 6 running under Linux.

**Remember:**

-   Before upgrading to the latest version of TestArchitect, it is strongly recommended that you back up all repositories.
-   A TestArchitect client and any repository server to which it connects must be of the same version.

## TestArchitect Client

**Enhancements to existing features**

-   [Deleting](/TA_Help/Topics/Projects_and_project_items_delete_project.html) TestArchitect projects containing project items is now supported.

## TestArchitect Automation

-   [hold key](/TA_Automation/Topics/bia_hold_key.html) built-in action: Hold specified keyboard key\(s\) down.
-   [release key](/TA_Automation/Topics/bia_release_key.html) built-in action: Release the specified key\(s\) that were previously held down using the [hold key](/TA_Automation/Topics/bia_hold_key.html) built-in action.

## Deprecation

-   global pos property on web automation has been deprecated. We highly recommend that you use [XPath](/TA_Help/Topics/prop_xpath.html) instead.
