The following new features and improvements are introduced in TestArchitect version 8.2 Update 6 running under Linux.

{{<remember>}}

-   Before upgrading to the latest version of TestArchitect, it is strongly recommended that you back up all repositories.
-   A TestArchitect client and any repository server to which it connects must be of the same version.

## TestArchitect Client

Enhancements to existing features

-   [Deleting](/user-guide/projects-and-project-items/projects-in-testarchitect/delete-a-project) TestArchitect projects containing project items is now supported.

## TestArchitect Automation  

-   [hold key](/automation-guide/action-based-testing-language/built-in-actions/system-actions/keyboard/hold-key) built-in action: Hold specified keyboard key\(s\) down.
-   [release key](/automation-guide/action-based-testing-language/built-in-actions/system-actions/keyboard/release-key) built-in action: Release the specified key\(s\) that were previously held down using the [hold key](/automation-guide/action-based-testing-language/built-in-actions/system-actions/keyboard/hold-key) built-in action.

## Deprecation

-   global pos property on web automation has been deprecated. We highly recommend that you use [XPath](/user-guide/interface-definitions/control-properties/secondary-properties/xpath-property) instead.
