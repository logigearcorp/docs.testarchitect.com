If a current baseline result record is no longer needed, or is to be supplanted, you can remove its designation as a baseline.

Ensure that TestArchitect is running and log in to the repository containing the baseline test result whose baseline designation you wish to remove.

To unset a baseline test result:

-   **Option 1**:

    1.  In the TestArchitect explorer tree, right-click the baseline test result node that you want to unset, and then select **Unset Baseline**

-   **Option 2:**

    1.  In the TestArchitect explorer tree, double-click the test result node for which you want to unset the baseline.

    2.  Click the **Unset Baseline** ![](/images/TA_Help/Images/baseline_set_btn.png) button on the main panel.

        ![](/images/TA_Help/Images/ug_resultbaseline4.png)

-   **Option 3**:

    1.  Open the repository test result list view.

        For example: Double-click the **Results** node in the TestArchitect explorer tree.

    2.  In the test result list view, select the result\(s\) you want to unset, and then right-click the selection.

    3.  Select **Unset Baseline** from the context menu.


The **B** icon overlay on the baseline test result disappears, indicating that the result is no longer serving as a baseline.
