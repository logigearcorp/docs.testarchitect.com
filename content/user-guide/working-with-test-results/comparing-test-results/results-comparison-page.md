The Result comparison page which is available on a web browser displays the differences, side-by-side, between two test results at checkpoints defined in the test procedure.

The Results Comparison HTML page, as illustrated in the images below, displays the typical checkpoint output when two test results are compared. There are two tabs including **Summary** and **Comparison Details**.

-   **Checks passed**

    The number of checks that passed in the baseline test, and passed in the recent test.

-   **New fails**

    The number of checks that passed in the baseline test, but failed in the recent test.

-   **Known fails**

    The number of checks that failed in the baseline test, and failed in the recent test.

-   **Resolved fails**

    The number of checks that failed in the baseline test, but passed in the recent test.

-   Individual test cases may be hidden or shown by clicking the **\[-\]** or **\[+\]** icons in the headers.
-   To quickly collapse/expand all test case nodes in the **Comparison Details** tab, click the **Collapse All/Expand all** button.
-   By default, ten checkpoint items are displayed per page in the **Comparison Details** tab. To display more or fewer items, select a desired value from the **Display** drop-down list.
-   The drop-down list, next to the **Expand All** button, offers you various options for displaying results:
    -   **Show all**

        Displays comparisons of all checkpoints, regardless of the results.

    -   **Show different check\(s\) only**

        Displays the checks that either failed in the baseline, but now passed in the test, or vice versa.

    -   **Show new fail\(s\) only**

        Displays the checks that passed in the baseline test, but failed in the recent test.

    -   **Show resolved fail\(s\)**

        Displays the checks that failed in the baseline test, but passed in the recent test.

    -   **Show different errors/warnings**

        Displays the checks that passed with warning/error status.


## {{< expand >}} Comparing serial run results {{< permerlink >}} {#Test_result_baseline_result__sect_nd6h_kd83} 

If the baseline test result is a set of serial test results, an additional Comparing Multiple Paris of Results dialog box appears to show the differences between pairs of results.

To view a detailed comparison of a pair of results generated by the same test module:

1.  Select the row containing the test module of interest.
2.  Click the **View** button. The Results Comparison HTML page appears.
