How to manually store local test results to the repository.

{{<important>}} Note that, if you add test results to the repository automatically, all [unverified picture checks](/user-guide/support/glossary-of-terms/unverified-picture-check) will be totally discarded. Whereas, adding test results to the repository manually preserves all picture checks.

Perform the following steps:

-   **Option 1:**

    1.  Select the local test results that you want stored to the repository.

        You can select local test results in the TestArchitect explorer tree, or in the [local test result list view](/user-guide/projects-and-project-items/project-items/list-view/result-list-view/local-result-list-view).

    2.  Right-click the selection, and select **Add to Repository**.

    3.  In the Select a Destination dialog box, specify a location in the repository results tree to which the local test results are to be stored.

    4.  Click **OK**.

-   **Option 2:**

    1.  In the TestArchitect explorer tree, double-click a local test result node of results you want stored to the repository.

    2.  Click the **Add results to repository** ![](/images/TA_Help/Images/add_results_to_repo_icon.png) icon on the main panel.

        ![](/images/TA_Help/Images/add_results_to_repo_icon_main_panel.png)


After being stored in the repository, the results can be:

-   renamed, by typing F2 on your keyboard \(or click **Rename** from the context menu\).
-   organized inside result folders, similar to the manner in which test modules may be organized into test folders.
