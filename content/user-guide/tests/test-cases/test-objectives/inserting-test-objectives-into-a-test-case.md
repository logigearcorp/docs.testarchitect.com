After declaring test objectives in the `Objectives` section, you can insert test objectives into a test case.

To insert test objectives into a test case, perform the following steps:

1.  Select a cell in the a `TEST CASE` section in which you want to insert the test objectives \(column A\).

2.  Type [test objective](/automation-guide/action-based-testing-language/built-in-actions/test-support-actions/documentary/test-objective) and press Enter on your keyboard.

    {{<note>}} To ensure a clear and structured approach, it is suggested that you list test objectives at the top of each test case in the editor worksheet.

    TestArchitect's auto-complete functionality will suggest possible test objectives as you type.

3.  Select the desire test objective in the drop-down list box.


The title of the selected test objective is written to the next cell.![](/images/TA_Help/Images/ug_testobjective_inserting.png)
