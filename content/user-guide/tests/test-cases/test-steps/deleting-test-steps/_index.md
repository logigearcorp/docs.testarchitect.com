If you no longer need test steps, you can delete them from the test case.

To delete test steps, do the following steps:

1.  [Check out](/TA_Help/Topics/Project_items_checkout.html) a test module.

2.  In the TestArchitect explorer tree, double-click the test case containing test steps that you want to delete.

    The steps list view appears in the main panel.

3.  You can select a test step or multiple test steps:

    -   One left-click to select a single test step.
    -   Shift + left-click to select a contiguous range of test steps.
    -   Control + left-click to select multiple noncontiguous test steps.
4.  Click **Delete**.

    A dialog box appears asking for your confirmation.

5.  Click **Yes** to confirm the deletion.

    The selected test steps are removed from the step list view.

6.  Click **Apply** to save changes.


The deleted test steps are removed from the test procedure.
