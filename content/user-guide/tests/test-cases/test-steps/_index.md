Test steps break up a test case into multiple smaller sections, which can be maintained in an easier manner.

1.  [Creating test steps](/TA_Help/Topics/Projects_and_tests_steps_creating.html)  
Create test steps with the steps list view.
2.  [Inserting test steps into a test case](/TA_Help/Topics/Projects_and_tests_steps_using.html)  
If the **Automatically insert step to test case** check box in Preferences is currenty cleared, you can manually insert test steps into a test case.
3.  [Modifying test steps](/TA_Help/Topics/Projects_and_tests_steps_modifying.html)  
After creating test steps, you can modify them.
4.  [Deleting test steps](/TA_Help/Topics/Projects_and_tests_steps_deleting.html)  
If you no longer need test steps, you can delete them from the test case.
