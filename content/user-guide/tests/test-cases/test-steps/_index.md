Test steps break up a test case into multiple smaller sections, which can be maintained in an easier manner.

1.  [Creating test steps](/user-guide/tests/test-cases/test-steps/creating-test-steps)  
Create test steps with the steps list view.
2.  [Inserting test steps into a test case](/user-guide/tests/test-cases/test-steps/inserting-test-steps-into-a-test-case)  
If the **Automatically insert step to test case** check box in Preferences is currenty cleared, you can manually insert test steps into a test case.
3.  [Modifying test steps](/user-guide/tests/test-cases/test-steps/modifying-test-steps)  
After creating test steps, you can modify them.
4.  [Deleting test steps](/user-guide/tests/test-cases/test-steps/deleting-test-steps)  
If you no longer need test steps, you can delete them from the test case.
