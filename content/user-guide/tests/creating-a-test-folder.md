It is generally recommended that, for projects of any significant size, you always use test folders to organize your test modules.

To create a test folder, do the following:

1.  In the TestArchitect explorer tree, right-click the **Tests** node, and then select **New Test Folder**.

    **Fastpath:** Ctrl + O

    The New Test Folder dialog box appears.

2.  In the dialog box, specify the test folder information:

    -   Name: The test folder name.
    -   Description: \(Optional\) Short description for the test folder.
3.  Click **Create**.


A new test folder appears as a node under the **Tests** node. You now have a folder to contain your tests, or a subset of them.

{{<tip>}} You can also create a test folder inside another test folders. There is no practical limit to the depth at which test folders may extend.
