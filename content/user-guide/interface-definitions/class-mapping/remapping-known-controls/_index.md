If an existing class mapping of a known control class is no longer suitable for your needs, you can remap the control class to another TA class.

**Important:** Custom class mapping is only supported for the following applications:

-   Windows Presentation Foundation \(WPF\)
-   Win32
-   iOS
-   Android
-   Silverlight
-   Windows Forms \(WinForms\)
-   SAP
