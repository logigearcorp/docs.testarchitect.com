The **Highlight** ![](/images/TA_Help/Images/btn.highlight.png) button functionality within TestArchitect Client is nearly identical to that of the Interface Viewer, except that the context is provided by the interface-related nodes of the TestArchitect explorer tree. That is, you can select a given interface entity node in the tree, click **Highlight**, and if the matching application window is open, it comes to the foreground and flashes two or three times

Similarly, select a given interface element node, and click **Highlight**: if the window matching the element's parent node is open, it comes to the foreground, and the corresponding control is flashed.
