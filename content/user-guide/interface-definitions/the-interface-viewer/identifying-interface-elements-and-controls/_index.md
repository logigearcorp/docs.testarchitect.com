The Interface Viewer provides a few means of assisting you in relating nodes on the GUI Element Tree to actual physical items, and vice-versa. These can be used during the mapping process, or just to obtain information, such as finding the property-value pairs for a given control or window.

1.  [Point-to-identify mode](/TA_Help/Topics/Interface_def_Viewer_identify.html)  
When using the Interface Viewer to explore a complex window with many layers of controls, it is sometimes difficult to locate the **UI explorer** tree node corresponding to a given physical control. The point-to-identify feature, invoked via the **Identify** ![](/images/TA_Help/Images/btn_Identify.png) button on the Viewer's toolbar, simplifies this process.
2.  [Highlight](/TA_Help/Topics/Interface_def_Viewer_highlight.html)  
The **Highlight** feature of the Interface Viewer might be considered the flip side of the **point-to-identify** coin. Whereas **point-to-identify** allows you to start with a known control or window on an application and find its node in the UI explorer panel, **Highlight** allows you to start from a node in the tree and locate the physical object it represents.
