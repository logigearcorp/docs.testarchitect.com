By default, this toggle item on the **View** menu is enabled, which results in a display of all visible windows.

When no node is synced to an open interface entity, this item is also disabled. However, when a node is synced, it is enabled, allowing you to de-select **Show All Processes**, and limit the UI Explorer display to only the synced subtree.
