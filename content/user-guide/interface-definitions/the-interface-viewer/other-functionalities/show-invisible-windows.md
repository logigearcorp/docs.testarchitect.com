Getting the Interface Viewer's UI Explorer to display invisible windows.

In a Windows environment, there are typically many windows whose visible property has been set to False. By default, the Interface Viewer does not display invisible windows.

To have Interface Viewer display invisible windows:

1.  On the **View** menu, select **Show Invisible Windows**.


Depending on the number of invisible windows, you may have to wait a few minutes for the Viewer to refresh.
