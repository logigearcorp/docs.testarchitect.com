Interface entities can be exported to archive files \(.ZIP format\), which can be used as a backup or for re-importing.

Choose one of the following two methods to export interface entities:

-   **Option 1**:

    1.  In the TestArchitect explorer tree, right-click an interface entity node, and then click **Export to ZIP file**.

    2.  In the Export Interface Entity dialog box, click ![](/images/TA_Help/Images/btn.browse-ellipsis.01.png) to choose a location to save the file \(in .ZIP format\).

{{<tip>}} You can accept the default location, but any place that is easy to remember will work.

    3.  Click **OK**.

        A notification message dialog box appears indicating that the export was successful.
