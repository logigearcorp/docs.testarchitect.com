Lab Manager may be started from TestArchitect Client, a Dashboard instance, or any browser on machines with a connection to the web server running the Lab Manager application.

The Lab Manager application is installed with the installation of the TestArchitect Client. Lab Manager may be started directly from a browser or from Dashboard; however, it is typically launched from within TestArchitect Client.
