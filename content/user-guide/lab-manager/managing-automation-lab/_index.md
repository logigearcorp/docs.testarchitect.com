A Lab Manager session displays and monitors all those TestArchitect controllers that are registered to the session.

One should note that, while a Lab Manager session may monitor any number of controllers, a controller may be registered to only one Lab Manager session at any given time.

Registration may be handled from either end: that is, you may register a controller to a Lab Manager session from within Lab Manager, or self-register the controller, which means, perform the registration from the controller itself.
