How to register a controller from Lab Manager.

To register a new controller to a Lab Manager session from the session itself, ensure that you are logged in to the session with **administrator** rights.

1.  On the Lab Manager toolbar, click the **Add** ![](/images/TA_Help/Images/LabManager_add_controller_btn.png) button. The Add New Machine dialog box appears.
2.  In the dialog box, specify an IP address \(or machine name\) and port \(default: 53600\) for the controller to be added:

3.  Click **OK**. If the controller can be found on the network, that controller is added to the session.

{{<note>}} A controller may only be registered to a single Lab Manager session at a time. If TestArchitect cannot add the controller you specify, see [Troubleshooting controller registration](/TA_Help/Topics/Lab_manager_troubleshoot_controller_registration.html).
