Lab Manager is a web-based application that can be accessed through any browser from virtually anywhere within an organization.

TestArchitect users often find it necessary to run concurrent tests on multiple machines, sometimes hundreds at a time. Lab Manager offers the test manager the ability to monitor the status and progress of all the TestArchitect controllers and their corresponding devices running such tests, all from a single location.

In combination with TestArchitect Client's ability to initiate test runs on remote machines, Lab Manager provides the user with full control and monitoring capability for a cluster of test stations. Users can initiate test runs on remote machines, monitor test progress and status, and terminate tests as needed. Starting and stopping of test runs may be performed on any combination of controllers or devices. From a practical standpoint, there is essentially no limit to the number of controllers and devices that a single Lab Manager session may monitor.
