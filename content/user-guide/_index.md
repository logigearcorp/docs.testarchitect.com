This guide provides instructions on using TestArchitect. It also explains the environment requirements for TestArchitect and describes the process of running tests and reviewing test results.

TestArchitect is an integrated development and execution environment for automated software testing, one which allows you to rapidly and painlessly deploy and maintain large volumes of tests for your organization. It delivers this advantage by leveraging the benefits of Action Based Testing™, a proven action-keyword methodology for test automation. It also offers a countless number of features, tools, interfaces and options to allow you to automate far more tests than ever before, expand the capabilities of your tests, maintain your tests with greater ease, and get more useful information out of your test results.

This User Guide is intended for testers, automation specialists, developers and managers at all levels of mastery of the TestArchitect system.
