Project subscription aids in large-scale, complex test development. Tests distributed over multiple projects are allowed to share actions, interface definitions, data sets, and picture checks. \(Note that, in the case of picture checks, only [*shared* picture checks](/user-guide/support/glossary-of-terms/shared-picture-check) can be subscribed to.\)

1.  [Introduction to project subscription](/user-guide/projects-and-project-items/projects-in-testarchitect/project-subscription/introduction-to-project-subscription)  
By subscribing to other projects, you can avoid duplication of effort and allow your project to avail itself of the actions, data sets, interface definitions and picture checks that already reside in those projects.
2.  [Subscribing to projects](/user-guide/projects-and-project-items/projects-in-testarchitect/project-subscription/subscribing-to-projects)  
How to have your project subscribe to another.
3.  [Subscription rules](/user-guide/projects-and-project-items/projects-in-testarchitect/project-subscription/subscription-rules)  
TestArchitect employs a depth-first search \(DFS\) algorithm to locate, among subscribed projects, the definitions for actions, interface entities, interface elements, data sets, and picture checks.
