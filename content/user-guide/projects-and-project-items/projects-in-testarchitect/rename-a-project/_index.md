Renaming a project only changes the project's name and not its content.

Ensure that your TestArchitect Client is running and connected to the repository in which the project resides.

To rename a project:

1.  Right-click the project node in the TestArchitect explorer tree panel that you want to rename, and select **Rename**.

    **Fastpath:** F2

    ![](/images//Images/Projects_rename_project.png)

2.  Enter a new project name in the project's node text field, then hit Enter.
