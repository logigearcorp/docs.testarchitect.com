After creating a project, adding necessary test modules, and defining relevant actions and interfaces for those test modules, you are ready to execute the project’s test modules.

-   Ensure that your TestArchitect Client is running and connected to the repository where the project resides.
-   The project should have a test module and all related actions, interfaces and data.
-   The application to be tested is available and, if necessary, running.

To execute tests for a particular project:

1.  Right-click the project node in the TestArchitect explorer tree within which you want to execute the test.

2.  Select **Execute Test** from the context menu.

    **Fastpath:** F9
