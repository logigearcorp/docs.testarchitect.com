You can re-link a data set variation to other version nodes or keywords via the Edit Variation dialog box.

    For example: Double-click the **Data** node on the TestArchitect explorer tree.

    The data set list view appears in the main panel.

2.  Select a data set variation that you want to re-link to another version node or keywords.

3.  From the context menu, select **Edit Variation**.

    The Edit Variation dialog box appears.
