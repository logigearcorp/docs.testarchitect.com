List view displays a list of all items contained in the selected node and its subfolders. You can manage items directly in list view.

In the TestArchitect explorer tree, when you double-click

-   [**Tests**](/user-guide/tests/),
-   [**Data**](/user-guide/projects-and-project-items/project-items/data-sets/),
-   [**Actions**](/user-guide/actions/user-defined-actions/),
-   [**Interfaces**](/user-guide/interface-definitions/),
-   [**Test Suites**](/user-guide/projects-and-project-items/project-items/test-suites/),
-   [**Picture Checks**](/user-guide/projects-and-project-items/project-items/picture-checks/),
-   [**Results**](/user-guide/working-with-test-results/), or
-   [**Bugs**](/user-guide/projects-and-project-items/project-items/testarchitect-bugs/) node,

a list view of items belonging to the selected node is opened in the main panel. List views are also available for subfolders of the **Tests**, **Data**, **Actions**, **Interfaces**, **Test Suites**, **Picture Checks**, **Results**, and **Bugs** nodes.

List views also enable you to manage items with commands such as check in, check out, delete, copy text, and edit field. Right-clicking selected rows in a list view brings up the context menu where you can manage the selected items.

Below is an example of the **Test Module** list view context menu when more than one row is selected.
