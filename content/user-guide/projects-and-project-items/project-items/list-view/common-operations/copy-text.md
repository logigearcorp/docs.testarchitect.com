You can copy selected \(contiguous or noncontiguous\) rows from an item list view and paste them into a text document or spreadsheet.

1.  Open an item list view.

    For example: In the TestArchitect explorer tree, double-click the **Tests** node.

    The test module list view appears in the main panel.

2.  Select any set of rows in the list view, and then right-click the selection.

3.  Select **Copy Text** on the context menu, and paste the contents into another document.

    **Copy Text** copies all contents cell-by-cell, row-by-row and column-by-column with each column separated by a tab delimiter. You can copy items in a list view and paste them directly into various documents, such as those created by Microsoft Excel™, Microsoft Word™, or OpenOffice Calc™.
