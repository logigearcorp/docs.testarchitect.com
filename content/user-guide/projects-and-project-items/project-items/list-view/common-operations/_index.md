Various common operations can be performed over all items in list views, such as test module, test cases, data sets, and interface list views.

1.  [Field selection and display](/TA_Help/Topics/Listview_field_selection.html)  
You can perform basic functions on a list view, such as resizing the width and height of the list view, or selecting which columns to display.
2.  [Sorting](/TA_Help/Topics/Listview_field_sorting.html)  
Sorting all elements of a list view into ascending or descending order.
3.  [Copy Text](/TA_Help/Topics/Listview_copy_text.html)  
You can copy selected \(contiguous or noncontiguous\) rows from an item list view and paste them into a text document or spreadsheet.
4.  [Filters](/TA_Help/Topics/Listview_filtering.html)  
Use filters to reduce the set of items displayed in an item list view, and to limit operations to those items.
5.  [Editing multiple fields](/TA_Help/Topics/Listview_edit_fields.html)  
You can modify the field values of multiple items in an item list view by selecting **Edit Fields** from the context menu.
