Various common operations can be performed over all items in list views, such as test module, test cases, data sets, and interface list views.

1.  [Field selection and display](/user-guide/projects-and-project-items/project-items/list-view/common-operations/field-selection-and-display)  
You can perform basic functions on a list view, such as resizing the width and height of the list view, or selecting which columns to display.
2.  [Sorting](/user-guide/projects-and-project-items/project-items/list-view/common-operations/sorting)  
Sorting all elements of a list view into ascending or descending order.
3.  [Copy Text](/user-guide/projects-and-project-items/project-items/list-view/common-operations/copy-text)  
You can copy selected \(contiguous or noncontiguous\) rows from an item list view and paste them into a text document or spreadsheet.
4.  [Filters](/user-guide/projects-and-project-items/project-items/list-view/common-operations/filters)  
Use filters to reduce the set of items displayed in an item list view, and to limit operations to those items.
5.  [Editing multiple fields](/user-guide/projects-and-project-items/project-items/list-view/common-operations/editing-multiple-fields)  
You can modify the field values of multiple items in an item list view by selecting **Edit Fields** from the context menu.
