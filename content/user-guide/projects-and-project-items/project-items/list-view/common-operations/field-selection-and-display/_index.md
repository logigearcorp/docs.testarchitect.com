You can perform basic functions on a list view, such as resizing the width and height of the list view, or selecting which columns to display.

-   Resize the width of a column by dragging the column separator in the column header with the cursor.
-   Resize the height of a row by dragging the row separator with the cursor.
-   Select which columns to display in a list view by right-clicking on a column header and selecting/deselecting the names of the columns you want to display/hide.
-   You can select a contiguous range of rows by clicking on the range's first row and dragging the cursor to the range's last row while holding down the left-mouse button. Alternatively, left-click on the range's first row then left-click on the range's last row while pressing the Shift key.
