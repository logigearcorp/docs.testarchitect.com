You can re-link a user-defined action variation to other version nodes or keywords via the Edit Variations dialog box.

Ensure that the [user-defined action variation](/user-guide/variations/) that you want to re-link to other version nodes or keywords is [checked-out](/user-guide/projects-and-project-items/project-items/revision-control/check-out).

    For example: Double-click the **Actions** node on the TestArchitect explorer tree.

    The action list view appears in the main panel.

2.  Select an action variation that you want to re-link to another version node or keywords.

3.  From the context menu, select **Edit Variation**.

    The Edit Variation dialog box appears.
