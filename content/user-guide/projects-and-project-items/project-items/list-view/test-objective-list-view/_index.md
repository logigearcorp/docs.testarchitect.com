A test objective list view displays a list of all test objective items contained in a test module node.

On the TestArchitect explorer tree, when you double-click a test module node, and then select the **Test Objectives** tab. TestArchitect opens in the main panel a list view of test objective items for the selected test module. \(For details about test objectives, see [Test objectives](Projects_and_tests_TO.html).\)

The following operations can be performed on a test objective list view:

## Common operations

You can find various common operations that can be performed on test objective list views at [Common operations](Listview_common_operations.html).

## Opening test objective

You can view detailed information on a given test objective by selecting **Open** from the context menu, and then selecting the **Information** tab.

**Tip:** You can also open multiple test objectives by using your keyboard's Shift key to select a contiguous range of test objectives \(or Control to select multiple noncontiguous test objectives\); then right-click the selection, and click Open.

## Delete command

Use the **Delete** command, from the context menu, to remove the selected test objective\(s\).

## Name change propagation

Select **Rename** from the context menu to edit the name of a selected test objective. The name of the test objective is thus updated within its parent test module.
