The Bug list view displays a list of all bug items including linked and unlinked bugs. Those bug items are contained in the **Bugs** node on the TestArchitect explorer tree.

On the TestArchitect explorer tree, when you double-click the [**Bugs**](/user-guide/projects-and-project-items/project-items/testarchitect-bugs/) node, TestArchitect opens a list view of bugs in the main panel.

Here are features for using the Bug list view:

-   [**Searching**](/user-guide/projects-and-project-items/project-items/list-view/common-operations/filters): Use filters to quickly find a bug within the list view.
-   [**Sorting**](/user-guide/projects-and-project-items/project-items/list-view/common-operations/sorting): Sort your bugs into alphabetical order.
-   **[Opening](/user-guide/projects-and-project-items/project-items/testarchitect-bugs/viewing-ta-bugs)**: Multiple bugs can be opened quickly from the context menu.
-   **[Deleting](/user-guide/projects-and-project-items/project-items/testarchitect-bugs/deleting-ta-bugs)**: Delete one or multiple bugs within the list view.
-   **[Viewing related items](/user-guide/projects-and-project-items/project-items/testarchitect-bugs/#section_rkf_vtw_mn)**: View those test modules holding TestArchitect bugs.

{{<tip>}} To update the TA bug from the fields of its JIRA counterpart, click the **Refresh** button. Note, however, that a minimum interval of 60 seconds between refreshes is imposed for a given TestArchitect Client.
