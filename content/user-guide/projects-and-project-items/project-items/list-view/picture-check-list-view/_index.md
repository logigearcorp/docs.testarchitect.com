A picture check list view displays a list of all picture checks contained in the **Picture Checks** node or one of its subfolders.

On the TestArchitect explorer tree, when you double-click the **Picture Checks** node, and then select the **Pictures** tab. TestArchitect displays in the main panel a list view of the picture checks for the project. \([Learn more](/TA_Help/Topics/Projects_and_tests_picture_check.html).\)

{{<note>}} Picture check list views are also available for subfolders of the **Picture Checks** node.

Following operations can be performed on the picture check list view:

## Common operations

You can find various common operations that can be performed on the contents of picture check list views at [Common operations](/TA_Help/Topics/Listview_common_operations.html).

## Opening multiple picture checks

You can open multiple picture checks by using your keyboard's Shift key to select a contiguous range of picture checks \(or Control to select multiple noncontiguous picture checks \); then right-click the selection, and click Open.

## Adding new baseline

You can save a captured screen image as a new baseline for an existing image. \(For details, see [Saving new baseline image](/TA_Help/Topics/Additional_features_image_capturing_add_new_baseline.html) and [Baseline Picture](/TA_Help/Topics/Projects_and_tests_picture_check.html#section_mwp_1d1_1l).\)

## Cut-Paste operations, and Delete command

-   From a picture check list view, you can remove a given picture check from one picture check folder and paste it to another by performing the **Cut** and **Paste** operations from the context menu.

{{<tip>}}

    -   In addition to the conventional cut-and-paste and copy-and-paste from the context menu, you can drag and drop a project item, or a selection of items, from a list view into a folder or node of the same type in the TestArchitect explorer tree.
    -   Performing drag-and-drop within the same project is equivalent to cutting and pasting. Performing a drag-and-drop across different projects, on the other hand, is a copy-and-paste operation.
    -   During a drag operation, at any time your mouse pointer is over a location that cannot accept the type of item being dragged, the pointer turns into a black crossed circle ![](/images/TA_Help/Images/black_cross_icon.png). Releasing the mouse button at this point simply cancels the operation.
-   Use the **Delete** command from the context menu, to remove a selected picture check.
