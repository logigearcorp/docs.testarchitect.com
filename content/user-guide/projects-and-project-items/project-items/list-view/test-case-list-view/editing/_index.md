You can directly edit the value of a field in a test case list view.

[Editable fields](/TA_Help/Topics/Listview_editable_fields.html) fields of test cases listed in test case list views can be edited directly.

1.  Open the test case list view.

    For example: Double-click the **Tests** node on the TestArchitect explorer tree, and then select the **Test Cases** tab.

    The test case list view appears in the main panel.

2.  Select a test case in the test case list view \(for example, One customer can order many reservations successfully\).

3.  Double-click an [editable field](/TA_Help/Topics/Listview_editable_fields.html) of the selected test case \(for example, the Name field\), or press F2 on the keyboard.

    The selected field becomes the active cell.

4.  Enter the new data.

    **Tip:** For the multi-line fields, such as Notes, Description, etc., press Alt + Enter to insert new lines within the cell.

5.  Press the Enter key to complete the change.


The field is edited and updated.
