A test case list view displays a list of all test cases contained in the **Tests** node or in one of its subfolders. Various commands can be executed within a test case list view.

On the TestArchitect explorer tree, when you double-click the **Tests** node, and then select the **Test Cases** tab. TestArchitect opens a list view of test cases for all test modules in the project. \([Learn more](/TA_Help/Topics/Projects_and_tests_TC.html).\)

**Note:** Similarly, test case list views are also available for subfolders of the**Tests** node.

The following operations can be performed on a test case list view:

## Common operations

You can find various common operations that can be performed on a test case list view at [Common operations](/TA_Help/Topics/Listview_common_operations.html).

## Opening test steps

Steps break up a test case into smaller sections which can be maintained in an easier way. You can display the steps of a test case in the main panel by selecting **Open** on the context menu \(see [Steps](/TA_Help/Topics/Projects_and_tests_steps.html) for details\).

**Tip:** You can also open multiple test cases by using your keyboard's Shift key to select a contiguous range of test cases \(or Control to select multiple noncontiguous test cases\); then right-click the selection, and click Open.

## Opening a test case in a test module

From a test case list view, you can conveniently display a test case of a given test module within the editor by selecting **Open test case in test module** from the context menu.

## Cut-Copy-Paste operations, and Delete command

-   From a test case list view, you can remove a given test case from one test module and paste it to another by performing a **cut-and-paste** operation from the context menu.
-   The **copy-and-paste** operation from the context menu allows you to create a duplicate of the selected test case.
-   Use the **Delete** command from the context menu to remove the selected test case\(s\).

## Name change propagation

Select **Rename** from the context menu to edit the name of a selected test case. The name of the test case is thus updated within its parent test module.

## Exporting test cases to CSV files

Test cases can be exported to [.CSV](/TA_Help/Topics/Exporing_to_CSV_test_case.html) files, which can be used as a backup or for re-importing into a TestArchitect test module.

-   **[Replacing](/TA_Help/Topics/Listview_test_case_replacing.html)**  
You can automatically replace a word or phrase with another in a field of a test case list view.
-   **[Editing](/TA_Help/Topics/Listview_test_case_editing.html)**  
You can directly edit the value of a field in a test case list view.
-   **[Changing source ID](/TA_Help/Topics/Listview_test_case_changing_source.html)**  
You can change the source IDs of test cases in test case list views.
