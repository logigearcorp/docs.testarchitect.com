Baseline images can be exported to image files \(.PNG format\), which can be used as a backup or for re-importing.

To export a given baseline image, do the following:

1.  In the TestArchitect explorer tree, select a baseline image that you'd like to export.

    -   For a [regular picture check](/user-guide/projects-and-project-items/project-items/picture-checks/#li_Regular_picture_check), go to **Local Pictures**, residing under the **Picture Checks** tab of a specific test module.

        ![](/images/TA_Help/Images/export_regular_baseline_image.png)

    -   For a [shared picture check](/user-guide/projects-and-project-items/project-items/picture-checks/#li_Regular_picture_check), go to the **Picture Checks** node, or its subfolder node.

        ![](/images/TA_Help/Images/export_shared_baseline_image.png)

2.  Right-click the selection, and then select **Export**.

3.  In the Save As dialog box, select a new file name and/or a new location, or leave them as default.

    {{<note>}} Only .PNG format is supported.

    ![](/images/TA_Help/Images/export_picture_check_save_as_dlg.png)

4.  Click **Save**.


The selected baseline image has been exported successfully.
