To import additional baseline images into an existing picture check, do the following:

1.  In the TestArchitect explorer tree, select a picture check to which you'd like to import additional baseline images:

    -   For a [regular picture check](/user-guide/projects-and-project-items/project-items/picture-checks/#li_Regular_picture_check), go to **Local Pictures**, residing under the **Picture Checks** tab of a specific test module.

    -   For a [shared picture check](/user-guide/projects-and-project-items/project-items/picture-checks/#li_Regular_picture_check), go to the **Picture Checks** node, or its subfolder node.
