Both static test suites and dynamic test suites can be executed from the **Execute Test** dialog box.

To execute a test suite, do the following:

1.  Right-click the test suite you want to execute, then click **Execute Test** to invoke the Execute Test dialog box.

2.  In the dialog box, click **Execute**.

    The selected suite is executed.


Alternatively, you can click the **Execute Test** ![](/images/TA_Help/Images/Toolbar_Button_Execute.png) toolbar icon or click Ctrl + F9 on Windows \(macOS: ![](/images/TA_Help/Images/Mac_control_key.png) + ![](/images/TA_Help/Images/Mac_shift_key.png) + F9, Linux: Ctrl + Shift + F9\) on your keyboard.

**Tip:**

You can generate a .bat file to run the test suite by right-clicking the test suite and selecting **Generate batch file**. The .bat file contains the suite name and the executed test modules that are defined at run time.
