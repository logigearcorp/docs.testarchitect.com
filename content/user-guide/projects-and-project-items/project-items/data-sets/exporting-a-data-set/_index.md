Data sets can be exported to archive files \(.ZIP format\), which can be used as a backup or for re-importing.

Choose one of the following two methods to export data sets:

-   **Option 1**:

    1.  Select a data set node on the TestArchitect explorer tree, then right-click the node, and click **Export to ZIP file**.

    2.  In the Export Data Set dialog box, click ![](/images/TA_Help/Images/btn.browse-ellipsis.01.png) to choose a location to which to save the file \(in .ZIP format\).

{{<tip>}} You can choose the default location, but any place that is easy to remember will work.

    3.  Click **OK**.

-   **Option 2**:

    1.  Double-click the **Data** node on the TestArchitect explorer tree.

    2.  In the **Data Sets** list view in the main panel, choose a data set that you want to export, right-click it, and then click **Export to ZIP file**.

    3.  In the Export Data Set dialog box, click ![](/images/TA_Help/Images/btn.browse-ellipsis.01.png) to choose a location to which to save the file \(in .ZIP format\).

{{<tip>}} You can choose the default location, but any place that is easy to remember will work.

    4.  Click **OK**.


The test result archive file \(.ZIP\) is exported to the specified location.
