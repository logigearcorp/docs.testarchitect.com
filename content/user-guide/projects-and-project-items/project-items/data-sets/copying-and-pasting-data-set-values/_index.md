One means of contributing data values to a data set is by pasting them in, using the traditional copy-and-paste technique. The source of such values can be another application \(for example, Microsoft Excel™, MS Word™, or Notepad\) or another item in the TestArchitect editor itself. The copied data may be pasted into the grid of data set items as either raw data or data set values.

1.  Open a document of data values - an MS Excel spreadsheet, for instance.

2.  In the document, select, then copy, the area of data of interest.

3.  If not already running, launch the [TestArchitect Client](Getting_started_launching_the_testArchitect_client.html).

4.  In the TestArchitect explorer tree, double-click a data set node.

    The data set editor appears on the main panel.

5.  Choose one of the following options:

    -   In the editor, right-click any cell and select **Paste As Data Row**.

        **Fastpath:** Ctrl + Shift + V

    -   If you want to paste the data into the grid of data set items as raw data, select **Paste**.

        **Fastpath:** Ctrl + V


The [row](/TA_Automation/Topics/bia_row.html) actions are automatically generated in the first column along with the pasted data.

**Note:** If raw data is pasted into the test editor, the [row](/TA_Automation/Topics/bia_row.html) actions are not generated.
