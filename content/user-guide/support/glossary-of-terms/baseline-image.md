A bitmap image, generally captured from the display of the AUT and pre-stored, used as a reference for comparison against images produced by the AUT during automated testing. \(also called baseline picture\)

In TestArchitect, baseline images are stored within [picture checks](/user-guide/support/glossary-of-terms/picture-check). \(A single picture check may hold one or more baseline images.\) They are used by the [picture handling](/automation-guide/action-based-testing-language/built-in-actions/user-interface-actions/picture-handling/) actions to test for the presence of images displayed by the AUT during automated test.

Baseline images are used by picture handling actions employing both [pixel-by-pixel](/automation-guide/action-based-testing-language/the-test-language/image-comparison-techniques) detection as well as [key point image detection](/user-guide/projects-and-project-items/project-items/picture-checks/key-points-modification-tool/keypoint-object-detection).
