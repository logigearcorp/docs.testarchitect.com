An automated action prepared for use in an automated test.

In TestArchitect, actions are defined in worksheets, with each stored separately in the TestArchitect explorer tree tree. Action definitions behave similarly to functions in a programming language. They accept parameters \(arguments\) which can be passed to other actions used within the action. They can also have output parameters \(arguments\) to set variables for use later in a test module.

The term action definition is generally reserved for user-defined actions.
