A named property that TestArchitect automatically assigns to a GUI control \(or HTML element\) of the AUT during [intake](/user-guide/support/glossary-of-terms/window-intake). A captured control typically has several TA properties, along with their assigned values, derived from the control's [native properties](/user-guide/support/glossary-of-terms/native-property).

TA properties are classified into two types:

-   [primary properties](/user-guide/support/glossary-of-terms/primary-property), in which the assigned value is derived more or less directly from a given native property; and
-   [secondary properties](/user-guide/support/glossary-of-terms/secondary-property), in which the assigned value is calculated or algorithmically derived, and often based on more than one native property.
