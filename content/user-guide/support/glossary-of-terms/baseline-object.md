An image object, defined by a [keypoint profile](/user-guide/support/glossary-of-terms/keypoint-profile) of a given baseline image, and used as a reference for detecting the presence of similar objects in test images, based on the keypoint image detection method.

In TestArchitect, the [Key Point Modification Tool](/user-guide/projects-and-project-items/project-items/picture-checks/key-points-modification-tool/) is used to manually establish a keypoint profile \(a set of keypoints and keypoint descriptors\) for a given baseline image. This keypoint profile describes a baseline object, and is used to detect similar objects in test images, based on a similarity threshold \(**Min accuracy \(%\)** setting\) which is also established in the Key Point Modification Tool.
