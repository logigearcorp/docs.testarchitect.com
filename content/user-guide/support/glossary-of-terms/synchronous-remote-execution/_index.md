Execution mode in which, under program control, the tests on multiple controllers interact. Typically, this execution mode is used to test interactions between applications on separate hardware targets, such as applications that must communicate with each other, or access the same resource. Involves the designation of one controller as lead, which controls the initiation of execution on all others, known as deputies.

There are two types of synchronous remote execution:

-   [serial synchronous remote execution](glossarySerialSynchronousRemoteXqt.html)
-   [parallel synchronous remote execution](glossaryParallelSynchronousRemoteXqt.html)

Also referred to as: **lead-deputy execution**
