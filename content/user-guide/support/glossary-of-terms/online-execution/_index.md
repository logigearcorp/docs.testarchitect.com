Execution of a test run that has been initiated directly by an operator \(as opposed to [via a batch file](/TA_Glossary/Topics/glossaryOfflineExecution.html)\).

Typically, online execution is implemented through TestArchitect Client, by means of the Execute Test dialog box. It may also be performed at the command line by means of the TestArchitect command line tool. \(Typically, however, invocation of the command line tool is performed from a batch file.\)
