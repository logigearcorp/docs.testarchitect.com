User-determined name of a given GUI element \(window, dialog box, control, HTML element, etc.\), assigned in TestArchitect by means of interface mapping with [interface elements](/user-guide/support/glossary-of-terms/interface-element) and [entities](/user-guide/support/glossary-of-terms/interface-entity).

Also referred to as: **logical name**.

{{<note>}} Built-in UI-interactive actions that target controls \(including HTML elements\) use the argument name ta name to specify the control. Similarly, interface elements use the ta name argument to assign a TA name. Hence, references in documentation to the argument name itself are always all lowercase.
