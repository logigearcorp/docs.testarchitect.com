A custom action, created by a user. A user action can be implemented by one of two means:

-   User-defined actions, which are composed of other actions, both built-in and user;
-   User-scripted actions, which are written in a general-purpose language like Python or Java.
-   User-scripted actions, which are written in C\#.
