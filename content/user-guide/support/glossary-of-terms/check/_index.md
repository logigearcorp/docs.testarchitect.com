In the general test automation sense, a comparison of a system's expected behavior with its actual behavior.

In TestArchitect terms, a check is the action performed by one of the family of built-in check... actions \([check control exists](/TA_Automation/Topics/bia_check_control_exists.html), [check picture](/TA_Automation/Topics/bia_check_picture.html), etc.\), each of which compares expected vs. actual results, and registers the outcome as a pass or fail in the test result.

Also referred to as: **validity check**.
