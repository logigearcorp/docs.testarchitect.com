A set of filter criteria specified with the built-in [filter](/automation-guide/action-based-testing-language/built-in-actions/test-support-actions/data-sets/filter) action and assigned a name. This name may later be referenced \(by the [use data set](/automation-guide/action-based-testing-language/built-in-actions/test-support-actions/data-sets/use-data-set) or [use filter](/automation-guide/action-based-testing-language/built-in-actions/test-support-actions/data-sets/use-filter) action\) so as to apply the filter to incoming data for a test, eliminating rows not matching the criteria. \(See also [Named filters](/testarchitect-tutorial/part-2-becoming-a-testarchitect-power-user/lesson-7-creating-data-driven-tests/named-filters)\).
