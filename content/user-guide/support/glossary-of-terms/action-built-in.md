An action that is packaged with TestArchitect and available for use in your test modules and user-defined actions. TestArchitect includes a library of hundreds of built-in actions that, functionally, can be roughly grouped into three categories:

-   **[System actions](/automation-guide/action-based-testing-language/built-in-actions/system-actions/)**

    Actions that interact with the system of the AUT host, such as those that work with user input \(e.g., [type](/automation-guide/action-based-testing-language/built-in-actions/system-actions/keyboard/type), [click](/automation-guide/action-based-testing-language/built-in-actions/system-actions/mouse/click)\) , system resources \([get clipboard](/automation-guide/action-based-testing-language/built-in-actions/system-actions/clipboard/get-clipboard)\), or the host file system \([copy file](/automation-guide/action-based-testing-language/built-in-actions/system-actions/file-and-folder/copy-file)\).

-   **[Test Support actions](/automation-guide/action-based-testing-language/built-in-actions/test-support-actions/)**

    Includes automation control actions, like [if](/automation-guide/action-based-testing-language/built-in-actions/test-support-actions/control-flow/if) and [sleep](/automation-guide/action-based-testing-language/built-in-actions/test-support-actions/timing/sleep), and declaratory actions \([argument](/automation-guide/action-based-testing-language/built-in-actions/test-support-actions/action-definition/argument), [test case](/automation-guide/action-based-testing-language/built-in-actions/test-support-actions/documentary/test-case), [test objective](/automation-guide/action-based-testing-language/built-in-actions/test-support-actions/documentary/test-objective)\).

-   **[User Interface actions](/automation-guide/action-based-testing-language/built-in-actions/user-interface-actions/)**

    Actual automation actions, such as [enter](/automation-guide/action-based-testing-language/built-in-actions/user-interface-actions/control-element/enter) and [select menu item](/automation-guide/action-based-testing-language/built-in-actions/user-interface-actions/toolbar-menu-scrollbar/select-menu-item).
