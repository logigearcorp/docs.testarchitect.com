A property or attribute of a [GUI element](glossaryGUIElement.html) \(such as a window, dialog box, control, or HTML element\) of an application.

**Note:** Native properties are inherent to the application being tested, and are determined by the platform \(e.g., WPF, Win32, Android, etc.\) and possibly the developer as well. Native properties must be distinguished from [TA properties](glossaryTAProperty.html), which are the properties you work with when developing tests. During an [intake](glossaryIntake.html), TestArchitect translates native properties of targeted GUI elements to their TA property counterparts.
