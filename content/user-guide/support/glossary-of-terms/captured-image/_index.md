A bitmap image captured from the display of the AUT for storage or testing.

**Note:**

From the standpoint of picture handling, any image – [baseline](/TA_Glossary/Topics/glossaryBaselineImage.html), training, or test – that is captured from the AUT may be considered a captured image. Generally, however, the term is reserved for an image captured from the AUT during testing for the purpose of comparison against a baseline image.

The term [image under test](/TA_Glossary/Topics/glossaryImageUnderTest.html) is less ambiguous, referring specifically to an image captured from the AUT for the purpose of comparison against a baseline.
