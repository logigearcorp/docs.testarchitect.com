A named TestArchitect project item used to hold one or more baselines against which images from the AUT may be compared during automated testing. In addition to an image, a baseline of a picture check may hold other information for use when the comparison employs [keypoint image detection](/user-guide/projects-and-project-items/project-items/picture-checks/key-points-modification-tool/keypoint-object-detection).

{{<note>}} An alternate usage of the term is in reference to the actual process of a pass/fail comparison of a captured test image to the baseline\(s\) of a picture check during automated testing, as a result of the execution of a suitable action, such as [check picture](/automation-guide/action-based-testing-language/built-in-actions/user-interface-actions/picture-handling/check-picture) or [does picture exist](/automation-guide/action-based-testing-language/built-in-actions/user-interface-actions/picture-handling/does-picture-exist). Example: “The test performs a picture check every time a new image is called up from the AUT.”
