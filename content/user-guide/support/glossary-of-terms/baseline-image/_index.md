A bitmap image, generally captured from the display of the AUT and pre-stored, used as a reference for comparison against images produced by the AUT during automated testing. \(also called baseline picture\)

In TestArchitect, baseline images are stored within [picture checks](glossaryPictureCheck.html). \(A single picture check may hold one or more baseline images.\) They are used by the [picture handling](/TA_Automation/Topics/bia_picture_handling.html) actions to test for the presence of images displayed by the AUT during automated test.

Baseline images are used by picture handling actions employing both [pixel-by-pixel](/TA_Automation/Topics/aut_image_comparison_techniques.html) detection as well as [key point image detection](/TA_Automation/Topics/aut_keypoint_detection_method.html).
