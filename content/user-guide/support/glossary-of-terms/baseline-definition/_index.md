In picture handling, the process of establishing a baseline for comparison against test images produced by the AUT during testing. For [pixel-by-pixel](/TA_Automation/Topics/aut_image_comparison_techniques.html) comparison, this is a relatively straightforward process of acquiring an image and then, optionally, specifying a region of that image as a baseline. For [keypoint detection](/TA_Glossary/Topics/glossaryKeypointDetection.html) handling, it is the process, often iterative, of acquiring an image, generating keypoints, and establishing settings \([keypoint profile](/TA_Glossary/Topics/glossaryKeypointProfile.html) and [min accuracy](/TA_Automation/Topics/bia_set_picture_min_accuracy.html)\) to define the [baseline object](/TA_Glossary/Topics/glossaryBaselineObject.html).
