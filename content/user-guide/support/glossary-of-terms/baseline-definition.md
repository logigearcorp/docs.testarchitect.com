In picture handling, the process of establishing a baseline for comparison against test images produced by the AUT during testing. For [pixel-by-pixel](/automation-guide/action-based-testing-language/the-test-language/image-comparison-techniques) comparison, this is a relatively straightforward process of acquiring an image and then, optionally, specifying a region of that image as a baseline. For [keypoint detection](/user-guide/support/glossary-of-terms/keypoint-detection) handling, it is the process, often iterative, of acquiring an image, generating keypoints, and establishing settings \([keypoint profile](/user-guide/support/glossary-of-terms/keypoint-profile) and [min accuracy](/automation-guide/action-based-testing-language/built-in-actions/user-interface-actions/picture-handling/set-picture-min-accuracy)\) to define the [baseline object](/user-guide/support/glossary-of-terms/baseline-object).
