A TestArchitect project item used to represent a single dialog box, window, or full-screen item of the AUT's GUI interface. An interface entity appears in the TestArchitect explorer tree as a child of an interface. In the editor, an interface entity is presented as a worksheet containing:

-   a single [interface entity](/TA_Automation/Topics/bia_interface_entity.html) action line specifying the logical TA name of the entity;
-   one or more [interface entity setting](/TA_Automation/Topics/bia_interface_entity_setting.html) action lines, which map the interface entity to the physical GUI item, and provide other information to the automation;
-   [interface element](glossaryInterfaceElement.html) action lines.
