The list of actions that can be used for a given interface element. Membership in the list is based on the TA class of the control or HTML element to which that interface element is mapped. The list is also available for interface entities.

The applicable actions list is presented by the Content Assist mechanism of the TestArchitect test editor when you drag an interface element or entity into the editor worksheet. \(See [Applicable actions assistance](/TA_Help/Topics/ug_content_assist.html#section.applicable_actions).\)
