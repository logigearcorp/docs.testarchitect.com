A named TestArchitect project item used to hold one or more baselines against which images from the AUT may be compared during automated testing. In addition to an image, a baseline of a picture check may hold other information for use when the comparison employs [keypoint image detection](/TA_Automation/Topics/aut_keypoint_detection_method.html).

{{<note>}} An alternate usage of the term is in reference to the actual process of a pass/fail comparison of a captured test image to the baseline\(s\) of a picture check during automated testing, as a result of the execution of a suitable action, such as [check picture](/TA_Automation/Topics/bia_check_picture.html) or [does picture exist](/TA_Automation/Topics/bia_does_picture_exist.html). Example: “The test performs a picture check every time a new image is called up from the AUT.”
