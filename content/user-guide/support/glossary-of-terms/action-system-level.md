A single interaction with one interface element of an interface entity, such as the clicking of a button or entry of text into a text box.

TestArchitect offers a full range of ready-to-use system-level actions through its library of [built-in actions](/automation-guide/action-based-testing-language/built-in-actions/). It is also possible to implement custom system-level actions in the form of user-scripted actions.
