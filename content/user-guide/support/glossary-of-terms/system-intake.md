The process of surveying all windows \(including dialog boxes and web pages\) currently open on a test system, establishing their TA properties and values, and retaining that information in cache. During test development, TestArchitect performs a system intake whenever you open or refresh the Interface Viewer, allowing you to view the system's current window environment. During playback, system intake is performed on the test machine at automation startup, and again whenever deemed necessary by the automation.
