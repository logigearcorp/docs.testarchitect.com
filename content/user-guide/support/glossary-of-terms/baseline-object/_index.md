An image object, defined by a [keypoint profile](/TA_Glossary/Topics/glossaryKeypointProfile.html) of a given baseline image, and used as a reference for detecting the presence of similar objects in test images, based on the keypoint image detection method.

In TestArchitect, the [Key Point Modification Tool](/TA_Help/Topics/ug_Key_point_modify_tool.html) is used to manually establish a keypoint profile \(a set of keypoints and keypoint descriptors\) for a given baseline image. This keypoint profile describes a baseline object, and is used to detect similar objects in test images, based on a similarity threshold \(**Min accuracy \(%\)** setting\) which is also established in the Key Point Modification Tool.
