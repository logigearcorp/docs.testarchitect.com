The combination of [keyword signature](/TA_Glossary/Topics/glossaryKeywordSignature.html) and [system signature](/TA_Glossary/Topics/glossarySystemSignature.html) that defines a given variation of a TestArchitect project item.

**Note:** Note that, from the compile-time perspective, a variation whose variation signature includes n system nodes is effectively treated as n separate variations, each with a unique variation signature consisting of the same keyword signature along with a single system node.
