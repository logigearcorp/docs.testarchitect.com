A value or expression that is a parameter of an action. Just as programming languages like Visual Basic use arguments to accept inputs for functions, actions use arguments to accept inputs during automation execution.

TestArchitect declares arguments at the top of an action definition worksheet and in column headings above each action line.

{{<note>}} Sometimes arguments are referenced by number. A standard action definition table refers to an actionâ€™s name as argument 0, and subsequent columns from left to right as argument 1, argument 2, etc.
