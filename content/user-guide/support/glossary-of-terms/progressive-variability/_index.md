Gradual or progressive changes in a testable application, or in the environment \(i.e., systems and platforms\) in which the application is expected to perform. TestArchitect uses linked variations to address issues of progressive variability, where it is important that test configurations be maintained across a range of changes to the application and its operating environment.
