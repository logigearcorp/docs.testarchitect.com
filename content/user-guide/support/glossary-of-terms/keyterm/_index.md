A comma-delimited term within a variation's [keyword signature](/TA_Glossary/Topics/glossaryKeywordSignature.html). Within the keyword signature of an [explicit variation](/TA_Glossary/Topics/glossaryExplicitVariation.html), a keyterm may consist of a single keyword, or two or more keywords `OR`'d together \(complex keyterm\). \(Note that each keyterm of an [effective variation](/TA_Glossary/Topics/glossaryEffectiveVariation.html) is always a single keyword.\)

Note that the vertical bar \( \| \) is used to indicate `OR`ing of keywords in a keyterm.

As an example, the following keyword signature contains three keyterms, the first one consisting of a single keyword, and the last two being complex keyterms:

```
{vanilla, English|Spanish|French|Italian, Professional|Enterprise}
```
