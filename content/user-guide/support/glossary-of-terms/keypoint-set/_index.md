A set of keypoints associated with an image for the purpose of keypoint image detection.

In TestArchitect, a keypoint set is initially established by applying an image processing algorithm, known as SIFT \(scale invariant feature transform\) to the image. In the case of baseline images, the user may reduce the number of keypoints in the baseline's keypoint set via the [Key Point Modification Tool](/TA_Help/Topics/ug_Key_point_modify_tool.html), in order to optimize keypoint image detection in the picture handling actions. In general, the term keypoint set is reserved for the set of keypoints that the user has selected to permanently associate with a baseline image.
