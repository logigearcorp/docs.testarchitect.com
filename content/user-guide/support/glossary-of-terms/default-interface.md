The interface of a project that is to be automatically used by a test if no other interface is specified within the test. A default interface is designated in TestArchitect Client with the Set as Default Interface command. \(Note that, if the project only holds one interface, that interface is automatically the default.\) The [use interface](/automation-guide/action-based-testing-language/built-in-actions/test-support-actions/interface-handling/use-interface) action may be used in a test to override the default interface.
