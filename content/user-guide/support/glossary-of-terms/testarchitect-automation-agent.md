A browser extension that allows automated web testing to be conducted by TestArchitect. The extension is automatically installed in existing \(Chrome, Firefox, and Internet Explorer\) browsers on a given machine during TestArchitect installation. Post-installation, it may also be installed in a newly introduced browser by means of TestArchitect's [Automation Agent Manager](/automation-guide/application-testing/testing-web-and-ria-applications/testing-web-applications/automated-web-testing-with-non-webdriver/preparing-web-browsers/automation-agent-manager).

Also referred to as: **TA Automation Agent**.
