The class of a given control as it is known within the platform \(such as WPF, UIA, Win32 or Android\) upon which its parent AUT is based.

**Note:** Native control classes must be distinguished from TA classes, which are the classes you work with when developing tests. During intake, TestArchitect translates native control classes of targeted GUI elements to their TA class counterparts.
