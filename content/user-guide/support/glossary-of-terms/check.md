In the general test automation sense, a comparison of a system's expected behavior with its actual behavior.

In TestArchitect terms, a check is the action performed by one of the family of built-in check... actions \([check control exists](/automation-guide/action-based-testing-language/built-in-actions/user-interface-actions/control-element/check-control-exists), [check picture](/automation-guide/action-based-testing-language/built-in-actions/user-interface-actions/picture-handling/check-picture), etc.\), each of which compares expected vs. actual results, and registers the outcome as a pass or fail in the test result.

Also referred to as: validity check.
