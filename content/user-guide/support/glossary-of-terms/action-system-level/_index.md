A single interaction with one interface element of an interface entity, such as the clicking of a button or entry of text into a text box.

TestArchitect offers a full range of ready-to-use system-level actions through its library of [built-in actions](/TA_Automation/Topics/bia_Built_in_actions.html). It is also possible to implement custom system-level actions in the form of user-scripted actions.
