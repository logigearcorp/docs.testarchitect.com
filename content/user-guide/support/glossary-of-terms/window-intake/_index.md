The process of scanning a specific window \(or dialog box or web page\) on a test system for the controls \(or HTML elements\) it contains. TA classes, TA properties and TA property values of the controls are retained in cache. During test development, TestArchitect performs a window intake whenever you open or refresh a window in the Interface Viewer's UI Explorer tree. During playback, window intakes are performed as needed, based on the requirements of the test.
