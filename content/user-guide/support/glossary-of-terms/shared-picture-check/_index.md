A [picture check](/TA_Glossary/Topics/glossaryPictureCheck.html) that is owned by a given project, and available in TestArchitect Client through the **Picture Checks** node of the project.

**Note:** TestArchitect can store a picture check as either a shared picture check or [regular picture check](/TA_Glossary/Topics/glossaryRegularPictureCheck.html). The two types vary in terms of where they are stored and their scope of availability. A shared picture check of a project is available to all test modules of the project.
