The combination of [keyword signature](/user-guide/support/glossary-of-terms/keyword-signature) and [system signature](/user-guide/support/glossary-of-terms/system-signature) that defines a given variation of a TestArchitect project item.

{{<note>}} Note that, from the compile-time perspective, a variation whose variation signature includes n system nodes is effectively treated as n separate variations, each with a unique variation signature consisting of the same keyword signature along with a single system node.
