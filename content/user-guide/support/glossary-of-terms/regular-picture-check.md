A picture check that is owned by a given test module, and available in TestArchitect Client through the **Picture Checks** subtab of the test module.

{{<note>}} TestArchitect can store a picture check as either a regular picture check or [shared picture check](/user-guide/support/glossary-of-terms/shared-picture-check). The two types vary in terms of where they are stored and their scope of availability. A regular picture check's availability is limited to the test module that it belongs to.
