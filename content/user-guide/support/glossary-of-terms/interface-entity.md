A TestArchitect project item used to represent a single dialog box, window, or full-screen item of the AUT's GUI interface. An interface entity appears in the TestArchitect explorer tree as a child of an interface. In the editor, an interface entity is presented as a worksheet containing:

-   one or more [interface entity setting](/automation-guide/action-based-testing-language/built-in-actions/test-support-actions/interface-handling/interface-entity-setting) action lines, which map the interface entity to the physical GUI item, and provide other information to the automation;
-   [interface element](/user-guide/support/glossary-of-terms/interface-element) action lines.
