A [picture check](/user-guide/support/glossary-of-terms/picture-check) that is owned by a given project, and available in TestArchitect Client through the **Picture Checks** node of the project.

{{<note>}} TestArchitect can store a picture check as either a shared picture check or [regular picture check](/user-guide/support/glossary-of-terms/regular-picture-check). The two types vary in terms of where they are stored and their scope of availability. A shared picture check of a project is available to all test modules of the project.
