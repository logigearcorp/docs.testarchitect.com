The process of scanning a given system's or application's GUI environment to identify the windows and/or controls present, and establish their TA classes, TA properties and TA property values. TestArchitect performs intakes as needed during both the development and execution phases of the test lifecycle. There are two types of intake: [system intake](/TA_Glossary/Topics/glossarySystemIntake.html), and [window intake](/TA_Glossary/Topics/glossaryWindowIntake.html).
