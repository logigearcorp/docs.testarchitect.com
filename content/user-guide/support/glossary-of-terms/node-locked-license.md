A license type that is available for TestArchitect [Universal](/user-guide/support/glossary-of-terms/testarchitect-universal) licenses. Under the node-locked system, a license is dedicated to a particular host, and not relinquished when TestArchitect is inactive on that host. As with host-based licenses, a node-locked license may be transferred between machines, except that more restrictions apply.
