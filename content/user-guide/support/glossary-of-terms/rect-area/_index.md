A rectangular area defined in some picture handling and OCR actions. The rect area is specified by positional \(left, top\) and/or size \(width, height\) arguments, with the positional arguments being relative to a given user interface element \(screen, window or control\). Unless there is no overlap between the rect area and the active UI element, that overlap defines the [active area](/TA_Glossary/Topics/glossaryActiveArea.html) for the action.
