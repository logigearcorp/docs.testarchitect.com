A named property that TestArchitect automatically assigns to a GUI control \(or HTML element\) of the AUT during [intake](/TA_Glossary/Topics/glossaryWindowIntake.html). A captured control typically has several TA properties, along with their assigned values, derived from the control's [native properties](/TA_Glossary/Topics/glossaryNativeProperty.html).

TA properties are classified into two types:

-   [primary properties](/TA_Glossary/Topics/glossaryPrimaryProperty.html), in which the assigned value is derived more or less directly from a given native property; and
-   [secondary properties](/TA_Glossary/Topics/glossarySecondaryProperty.html), in which the assigned value is calculated or algorithmically derived, and often based on more than one native property.
