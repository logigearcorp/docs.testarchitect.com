A [container class](/TA_Glossary/Topics/glossaryContainerClass.html) for which TestArchitect ignores all child controls during an [intake](/TA_Glossary/Topics/glossaryIntake.html) process, done for the purpose of avoiding performance hits in the event that certain containers hold large numbers of child controls whose testing is not required. \(Note that user has the option to [unlock such container classes](/TA_Help/Topics/Interface_def_container_class_unlock.html) when the child controls need to be accessed.\)
