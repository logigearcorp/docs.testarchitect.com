A value for a window or control argument in an action line which, instead of using a TA name, directly identifies a UI element through its TA class and TA property values.

Note that a dynamic identifier is not inherently dynamic. It is called dynamic because it is capable of holding variables, which in turn may hold different values under program control, and hence point to different controls and/or windows.

See [Dynamic identifiers](/TA_Help/Topics/The_test_language_dynamic_identifiers.html) for more information.
