[Online execution](/user-guide/support/glossary-of-terms/online-execution) initiated from TestArchitect Client \(as opposed to the command line\). Any given test run initiated by client-directed execution may involve the Execute Test dialog box, or the dialog box may be bypassed \(say, by hitting the F9 shortcut key\). In either case, the settings that apply to the run are those that were last present in the Execute Test dialog box for a test run in the given repository.
