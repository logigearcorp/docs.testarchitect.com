A value generated for a region of an image which has been compared to a baseline during the matching phase of keypoint image comparison. When a given region of a test or training image is deemed similar to the baseline object, a similarity index value, between 1 and 100%, indicates the degree of similarity. During automated testing, this value is compared to the current **Min Accuracy \(%\)** setting. If it exceeds **Min Accuracy**, a positive match is deemed to exist.
