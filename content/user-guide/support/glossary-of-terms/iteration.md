-   [repeat](/automation-guide/action-based-testing-language/built-in-actions/test-support-actions/control-flow/repeat)/[until](/automation-guide/action-based-testing-language/built-in-actions/test-support-actions/control-flow/until)
-   [while](/automation-guide/action-based-testing-language/built-in-actions/test-support-actions/control-flow/while)/[end while](/automation-guide/action-based-testing-language/built-in-actions/test-support-actions/control-flow/end-while)
-   [use data set](/automation-guide/action-based-testing-language/built-in-actions/test-support-actions/data-sets/use-data-set)/[repeat for data set](/automation-guide/action-based-testing-language/built-in-actions/test-support-actions/data-sets/repeat-for-data-set)
