## Problem

Upon completion of an automated test, the following error message is reported in the Automation Problem dialog box, or in the test result:

The start program action could not complete. When run on an iOS device, start program requires that Apple iTunes be installed on the host machine. This host's version of iTunes is incompatible with the deviceâ€™s iOS version.

## Solution

Verify that a current or recent version of iTunes is installed on your test controller \(this may be a Windows or macOS machine\), then rerun the test.
