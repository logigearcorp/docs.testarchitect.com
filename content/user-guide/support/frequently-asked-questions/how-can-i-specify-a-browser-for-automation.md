In your test, use the [setting](/automation-guide/action-based-testing-language/built-in-actions/test-support-actions/value-handling/setting) action with the [use browser](/automation-guide/action-based-testing-language/built-in-settings/other-settings/use-browser) setting, then specify the browser in the following argument.

Note that Internet Explorer is the default browser only in the case of desktop web-based testing. For Android tests, Google Chrome is the default, while web-based applications running on iOS devices are defaulted to run in Safari.
