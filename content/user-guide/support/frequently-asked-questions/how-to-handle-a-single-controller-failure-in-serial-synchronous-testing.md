This depends upon the error handling actions set by the test module. Options for the [on error](/automation-guide/action-based-testing-language/built-in-actions/test-support-actions/error-handling/on-error) action include continue, exit action, or exit test case. The action [on error action](/automation-guide/action-based-testing-language/built-in-actions/test-support-actions/error-handling/on-error-action) allows for more user-customized error handling to be taken. These actions apply to conventional as well as synchronous tests.
