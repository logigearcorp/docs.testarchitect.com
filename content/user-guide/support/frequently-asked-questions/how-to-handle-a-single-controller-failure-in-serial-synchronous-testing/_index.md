This depends upon the error handling actions set by the test module. Options for the [on error](/TA_Automation/Topics/bia_on_error.html) action include continue, exit action, or exit test case. The action [on error action](/TA_Automation/Topics/bia_on_error_action.html) allows for more user-customized error handling to be taken. These actions apply to conventional as well as synchronous tests.
