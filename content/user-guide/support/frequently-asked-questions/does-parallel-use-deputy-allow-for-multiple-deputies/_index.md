Yes, if parallel is specified for a [use deputy](/TA_Automation/Topics/bia_use_deputy.html) action, the block of action lines up until the next [use lead](/TA_Automation/Topics/bia_use_lead.html) or use deputy is executed by the assigned deputy, while that next use... action is immediately executed by the lead. \(If that use... action is a use lead, the lead continues executing the subsequent action lines; if it's a use deputy, that next block of action lines is assigned to another deputy for immediate execution, and the lead again continues with the action line following that block â€“ that is, another use... action\).

The actions [wait for deputy](/TA_Automation/Topics/bia_wait_for_deputy.html) and [wait for all deputies](/TA_Automation/Topics/bia_wait_for_all_deputies.html) are indeed used to synchronize the lead with the deputies' completion of their action line blocks. Note, by the way, that these two wait actions are only executable by the lead.
