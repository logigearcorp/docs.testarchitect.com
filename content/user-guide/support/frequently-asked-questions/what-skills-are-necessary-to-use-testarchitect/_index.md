Test engineers and business analysts can use TestArchitect to create executable tests, without any prior knowledge of coding scripts. Using their test design skills and product knowledge, they may create tests which are defined as a series of action keywords.

Using built-in action components, included in the program or added by your organization's automation engineers, most steps in any test can be developed without any programming. Any new code that is required for new actions can be worked on, in parallel, by the automation engineers, improving delivery speed for everyone on the team.
