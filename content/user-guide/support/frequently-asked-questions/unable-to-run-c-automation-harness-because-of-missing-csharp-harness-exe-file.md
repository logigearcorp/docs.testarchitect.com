## Problem

In TestArchitect version [8.3](/user-guide/version-history/features-added-to-testarchitect-8-3/windows) or later, when you execute C\# automation harness, you may encounter the following automation error.

Since TestArchitect 8.3, [C\# bundle harness](/testarchitect-tutorial/part-3-extending-testarchitect/lesson-8-using-an-automation-harness/working-with-the-c-bundle-harness/) architecture has been introduced, but the connected repository was created in TestArchitect versions prior to 8.3. This repository remembers the setting of the legacy C\# automation harness. It is necessary to modify the setting to reflect new C\# bundle harness.

## Solution

To address this issue, do the following:

1.  In the [Automation Tools](/user-guide/test-execution/methods-of-test-execution/configuring-and-running-tests-from-testarchitect-client#li_ux4_421_zp) dialog box, from the Playback Tool field, ensure that **CSharp\_Harness** is selected.
2.  In the **Executable\(s\)** text box, point to the TestArchitect.Harness.Executor.exe file.

    {{<note>}} By default, this file is located at TA\_INSTALL\_DIR\\harness samples\\csharp\\executables\\TestArchitect.Harness.Executor.exe, once TestArchitect is installed.

3.  Run the C\# bundle harness as usual.
