This section guides you through the basics of starting to use your TestArchitect and the License Server.

## Installing TestArchitect

Run the TestArchitect Client installer and follow the instructions on screen.

For detailed instructions, please follow the below links.

-   [Windows](/user-guide/getting-started/testarchitect-installation-guide/windows/)
-   [Linux](/user-guide/getting-started/testarchitect-installation-guide/linux)
-   [macOS](/user-guide/getting-started/testarchitect-installation-guide/macos)

## Licensing in TestArchitect  

TestArchitect is sold on a node-locked or floating license basis. You must license your copy of TestArchitect before you can use it.

Licensing is handled through a License Server. Each time you start up TestArchitect, a License Server validates your license and grants usage rights. You need only register your license with a License Server one time. This is done by submitting a LogiGear-supplied key to a license server.

The License Server you use can reside either on your local machine, or on a remote system. The License Server you use for registration is the same server that will validate your license each time you use TestArchitect, so make certain that your License Server is installed on a machine that is always available. This is especially true in the case of multi-user licenses, where you want the active License Server to be available on your network to all valid users.

## Installing TestArchitect License Server

Run the TestArchitect License Server installer and follow the instructions to install TestArchitect License Server.

For detailed instructions, please follow the below links.

-   [Windows](/administration-guide/license-server/license-server-installation-guide/windows)
-   [Linux](/administration-guide/license-server/license-server-installation-guide/linux)

## Requesting a license key

To obtain your license key, please fill in the License Request form and submit it to us. For more information, read this [topic](/administration-guide/license-server/obtaining-a-testarchitect-license/requesting-a-license-key).

## Adding new license to the License Server

After you submit the request, a LogiGear representative will shortly contact you for verification, and then email you your personal key. Follow this [link](/administration-guide/license-server/obtaining-a-testarchitect-license/adding-new-licenses) to add new licenses to your License Server.

## Concepts of Action-Based Testing \(ABT\) language

See these diagrams [here](http://testarchitect.com/support/documentation/get-started) to understand the basics of TestArchitect's project items, the concept of interface mapping \(in which user interface objects are identified by their properties\), and a quick reference sheet related to Action-Based Testing language.

## Video tutorials

These [instructional videos](http://testarchitect.logigear.com/support/documentation/tutorial-videos) take you step-by-step through the test creation and execution process that will enable you to create and maintain large-scale test automation using TestArchitect.

6.  [Installing TestArchitect in silent mode](/user-guide/getting-started/installing-testarchitect-in-silent-mode/)  
In some cases, you may need to install TestArchitect in silent mode. In this mode, the installation is performed automatically without any user interaction.
7.  [Uninstalling TestArchitect in silent mode](/user-guide/getting-started/uninstalling-testarchitect-in-silent-mode/)  
In some cases, you may need to uninstall the current version of TestArchitect in silent mode before installing the newer version. In this mode, the uninstallation is performed automatically without any user interaction.
8.  [Using batch file to automate silent installation](/user-guide/getting-started/using-batch-file-to-automate-silent-installation)  
In practice, there are occasions where you might need to write and schedule a batch \(.bat\) file to automate the tasks of silent TestArchitect uninstallation and installation. This topic shows a basic template to follow.
9.  [Launching TestArchitect Client for the first time](/user-guide/getting-started/launching-testarchitect-client-for-the-first-time)  
 TestArchitect Client is the integrated test development and test management environment of TestArchitect.
10. [Working with repositories](/user-guide/getting-started/working-with-repositories/)  
TestArchitect stores its information in a database called a repository.
11. [Working with TestArchitect Client](/user-guide/getting-started/working-with-testarchitect-client/)  
TestArchitect Client provides you with an interface to create, manage, and execute your automated tests.
12. [The test editor](/user-guide/getting-started/the-test-editor/)  
TestArchitect provides you with a worksheet-like test editor to let you view, create and modify action-based tests.
13. [Sample Repository](/user-guide/getting-started/sample-repository/)  
The sample repository contains projects with test modules and other items designed work with sample applications \(also provided\) to demonstrate automated testing on a variety of platforms.
