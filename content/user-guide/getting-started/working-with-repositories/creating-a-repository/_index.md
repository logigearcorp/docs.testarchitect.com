The new repository is added to the **Repository** list. The repository is selected automatically from the list for quick access.

{{<note>}} New repositories are automatically assigned a single user account named administrator. By default, no password is assigned to this account. If this is a production repository, or one with sensitive contents, the password should be changed.
