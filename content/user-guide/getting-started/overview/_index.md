The features of TestArchitect are built upon a framework that offers you a powerful tool to integrate **Action Based Testing™**\(ABT\) into your testing organization.

Behind the worksheet-style interface is a sophisticated database structure that enables data and actions to be stored, shared, and managed in an efficient global team environment.

TestArchitect can integrate with test automation tools already adopted by a testing organization, while enabling all work to be organized within the ABT framework.

TestArchitect also offers standalone built-in automation, including many built-in system-level actions. These actions can be combined into user-defined actions that, quite often, provide all the test functionality you need.

Data-driven testing, an earlier and very important development in test automation, is also supported as part of the product’s worksheet-focused environment.

The Interface Viewer and Automation Playback tools can easily be extended to support other interfaces. TestArchitect offers automation playback for Windows, Web, .Net, WPF, Java, and other popular platforms.
