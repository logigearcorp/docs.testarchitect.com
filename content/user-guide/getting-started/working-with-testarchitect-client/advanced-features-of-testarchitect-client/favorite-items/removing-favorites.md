To remove favorite items, follow these steps.

2.  You can select a single favorite item or multiple favorite items by using the Shift or Control keys:

    -   One left-click to select a single favorite item.
    -   Shift + left-click to select a contiguous range of favorite items.
    -   Control + left-click to select multiple noncontiguous favorite items.
3.  Right-click the selection, and then click **Remove** from the context menu.

    {{<tip>}} You can also click the **Remove** button.

    The selected favorites are removed from the favorites list view.
