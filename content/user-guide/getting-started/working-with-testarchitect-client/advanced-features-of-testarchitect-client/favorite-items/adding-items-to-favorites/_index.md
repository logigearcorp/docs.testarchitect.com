Instead of memorizing favorite items, use TestArchitect Favorites to easily save items you’d like to revisit.

The simplest way to add items to favorites is to click the ![](/images/TA_Help/Images/favorite.gif) icon in the toolbar. Some alternative ways to add items to favorites are:

-   Option \#1: Right-click an open tab you want to add as to favorite, and then click **Add active tab to favorites** option.

    {{<tip>}} To bookmark all open items at once, click **Add all open tabs to favorites**.

-   Option \#2: Add a favorite item from the toolbar.

    1.  Click the down arrow next to the ![](/images/TA_Help/Images/favorite.gif) icon in the toolbar to see your options.
