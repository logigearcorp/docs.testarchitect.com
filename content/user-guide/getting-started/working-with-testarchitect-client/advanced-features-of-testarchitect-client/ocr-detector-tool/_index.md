The OCR Detector tool is used to improve the ability of OCR-related built-in actions to recognize texts.

The OCR Detector tool offers the following functions:

-   Retrieve color of a text, in hexadecimal, for the **text color** argument of [OCR-related built-in actions](/TA_Automation/Topics/bia_OCR.html).
-   Generate automatically action lines for the [set ocr setting](/TA_Automation/Topics/bia_set_ocr_setting.html) built-in action.
-   Help you identify text manually on a tested image to ensure that OCR-related built-in actions are able to detect the text.

{{<note>}} Note that the OCR Detector tool is not currently supported on Linux and macOS.
