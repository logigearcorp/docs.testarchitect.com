The OCR Detector tool is used to improve the ability of OCR-related built-in actions to recognize texts.

The OCR Detector tool offers the following functions:

-   Retrieve color of a text, in hexadecimal, for the **text color** argument of [OCR-related built-in actions](/automation-guide/action-based-testing-language/built-in-actions/user-interface-actions/optical-character-recognition/).
-   Generate automatically action lines for the [set ocr setting](/automation-guide/action-based-testing-language/built-in-actions/user-interface-actions/optical-character-recognition/set-ocr-setting) built-in action.
-   Help you identify text manually on a tested image to ensure that OCR-related built-in actions are able to detect the text.

{{<note>}} Note that the OCR Detector tool is not currently supported on Linux and macOS.
