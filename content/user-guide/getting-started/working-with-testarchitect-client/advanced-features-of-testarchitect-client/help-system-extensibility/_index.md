Custom actions require complete documentation to ensure correct usage.

The TestArchitect Help system extensibility feature enables you to extend TestArchitectâ€™s Help topics with your own topics and documentation system.

1.  [Configuring user-defined help](/TA_Help/Topics/Additional_features_Help_extensibility_configuration.html)  
To make use of Help-system extensibility for custom actions, you must modify the mapping file user\_defined\_help.ini, along with the corresponding commands.
2.  [Displaying action descriptions](/TA_Help/Topics/Additional_features_Help_extensibility_sensitive_help.html)  
The primary value of the Help System Extensibility feature is in allowing you to provide reference pages documenting your custom actions. Context-sensitive help functionality allows you to offer testers and automation engineers easy access to the actions' definitions and application notes.
