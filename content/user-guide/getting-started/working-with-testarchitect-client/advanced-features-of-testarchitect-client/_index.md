2.  [Help system extensibility](/TA_Help/Topics/Additional_features_Help_extensibility.html)  
Custom actions require complete documentation to ensure correct usage.

4.  [Opening recently used items](/TA_Help/Topics/Opening_recent_items.html)

The OCR Detector tool is used to improve the ability of OCR-related built-in actions to recognize texts.
