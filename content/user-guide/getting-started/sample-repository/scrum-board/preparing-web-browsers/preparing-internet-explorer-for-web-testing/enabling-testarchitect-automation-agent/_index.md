Enabling the TestArchitect Automation Agent in Internet Explorer is required for testing web-based applications with TestArchitect in that browser.

TestArchitect Automation Agent is automatically added as an add-on/extension to any installed browsers during TestArchitect installation. If you find that the TestArchitect Automation Agent is not present in your browser \(as would be the case if you installed the browser after installing TestArchitect\), you can use the [Automation Agent Manager](/reuse/../TA_Help/Topics/Test_exec_automation_agent_manager.html) to add the agent to your browser.

To enable the TestArchitect Automation Agent in Internet Explorer:

1.  Start Internet Explorer, then click **Tools** and select **Manage add-ons**.

2.  On the **Add-on Types** panel, select **Toolbars and Extensions**.

3.  On the main panel, look for the add-on named TestArchitect Automation Agent and verify that its status is Enabled. If the status is Disabled, click the **Enable** button to enable the add-on.

4.  Restart the browser to ensure that the change takes effect.


The TestArchitect Automation Agent is now enabled in Internet Explorer.
