On Windows and Linux machines, TestArchitect requires that the browser zoom be set to 100% to correctly identify HTML controls and their positions on web pages.

Mozilla Firefox uses 100% zoom by default. If you changed the zoom manually, you can restore it by doing one of the following.

-   Press Ctrl + 0.

-   From Firefox's main menu bar, select **View** \> **Zoom** \> **Reset**.
