The Scrum Board application, a part of the TestArchitect's automation sample test suite, is a web application that manages software development based on Scrum methodology.

After logging into Scrum Board you will see three main display panels: **To Do**, **In Progress**, and **Done**, which correspond to the status of the tasks on the Scrum Board. You can add task cards to the Scrum Board, edit existing task cards, or delete task cards. You can move cards between different panels to change their status. Each task card consists of a title, description, priority, component, estimate, spent, and assignee, and you can update the taskâ€™s properties at any time.

Scrum Board supports Internet Explorer, Google Chrome, and Mozilla Firefox web browsers and has both English and Spanish languages.
