Establishing a connection between the Android device and the host machine allows TestArchitect to communicate with mobile applications.

Ensure that you have installed the [TestArchitect Agent on the Android device](/TA_Tutorials_Sample_App/Topics/SR_Android_installing_TA_agent.html), and that you know the IP address of the host machine.

Perform the following procedure on the Android device to connect the device to the host machine via Wi-Fi:

1.  Enable the Wi-Fi connection on the Android device and connect to the host machine via Wi-Fi.

2.  On the Android device, start the TestArchitect Agent.

3.  On the TestArchitect Agent logon screen, enter the host machine IP address and click the **Connect** button.

If a connection to the host machine is established successfully, a Connected Successfully message appears on the device. To disconnect the Android device from the host machine, click the **Disconnect** button.
