This topic lists additional software requirements needed to support the integration of TestArchitect with third-party tools.

## Team Foundation Serverâ€“Microsoft Test Manager integration

-   To integrate with on-premise Team Foundation Server \(as opposed to cloud-based TFS\), you must install the supported versions of Visual Studio, which includes Team Foundation Server, Microsoft Test Manager, Test Agent, and Test Controller. \([Learn more](/user-guide/integration-with-third-party-tools/tfs-integration/on-premises-tfs-environment-configuration/).\)

## HP Quality Center integration

-   Interoperability between TestArchitect and HP Quality Center requires that the HP Quality Center Connectivity Add-In be installed on your computer \([Learn more](/user-guide/integration-with-third-party-tools/hp-quality-center/configuring-integration-with-hp-quality-center/)\). You can download the add-in from [HP Quality Center](https://centre.qualitat.solucions.gencat.cat/qcbin/TDConnectivity_index.html)
