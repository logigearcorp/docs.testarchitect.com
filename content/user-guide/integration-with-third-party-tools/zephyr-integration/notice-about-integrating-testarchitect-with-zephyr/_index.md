## Naming phases or cycles

The back slash \(\\\) is allowed in the names of phases or cycles in Zephyr. However, when TestArchitect generates batch files, this character is treated as a node separator from Zephyr's tree.

It is highly inadvisable to use the backslash in the names of your phases or cycles in Zephyr.
