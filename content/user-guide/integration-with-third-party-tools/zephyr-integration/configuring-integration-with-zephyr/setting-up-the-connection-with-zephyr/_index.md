Before you start working with Zephyr, you need to set up TestArchitect and Zephyr.

**Important:** TestArchitect-Zephyr integration supports the following versions of Zephyr.

-   [6.2](https://zephyrdocs.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/ZE61/pages/550633474/6.2+Release+Notes)
    -   [Zephyr Cloud](https://zephyrdocs.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/ZE61/pages/263521484/Zephyr+Enterprise+Cloud+Requirements)
    -   TestArchitect 8.4 Update 4 & 5

Begin by connecting your TestArchitect repository to a Zephyr server, which involves the following tasks:

1.  [Registering the Zephyr server](/TA_Help/Topics/ug_Zephyr_registering_server.html)  
Registering the Zephyr server is the first action you need to perform to prepare a TestArchitect-Zephyr integrated environment.
2.  [Mapping a TestArchitect project to a Zephyr project](/TA_Help/Topics/ug_Zephyr_mapping_projects.html)  
Mapping a TestArchitect project to a project in Zephyr allows for tests to be transferred bidirectionally between the two projects.
3.  [Configuring ZBots and installing ZIPs](/TA_Help/Topics/ug_Zephyr_ZBot.html)  
In order to execute TestArchitect test cases or test modules from Zephyr, a Zephyr Bot \(ZBot\) agent is required to form the link between the Zephyr server and the TestArchitect Client on your machine. Additionally, a custom TestArchitect ZIP project must be deployed on the TestArchitect Client machine.
