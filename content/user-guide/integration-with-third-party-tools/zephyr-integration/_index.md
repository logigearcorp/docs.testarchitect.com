Zephyr® is a powerful end-to-end test management tool that complements the test creation and automation capabilities of TestArchitect™. LogiGear provides an integration solution for Zephyr to harness the full potential of both TestArchitect and Zephyr.

{{<important>}} TestArchitect-Zephyr integration supports the following versions of Zephyr.

-   [6.2](https://zephyrdocs.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/ZE61/pages/550633474/6.2+Release+Notes)
    -   [Zephyr Cloud](https://zephyrdocs.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/ZE61/pages/263521484/Zephyr+Enterprise+Cloud+Requirements)
    -   TestArchitect 8.4 Update 4 & 5

Integration between TestArchitect and Zephyr involves establishing a connection between a TestArchitect repository and a Zephyr database. Once the connection is activated, TestArchitect then communicates with the Zephyr server using the Zephyr Rest API.
