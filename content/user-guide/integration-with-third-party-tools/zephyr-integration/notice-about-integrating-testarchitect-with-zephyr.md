## Naming phases or cycles {{< permerlink >}} {#ug_Zephyr_notice__section_tjh_y1b_pfb} 

The back slash \(\\\) is allowed in the names of phases or cycles in Zephyr. However, when TestArchitect generates batch files, this character is treated as a node separator from Zephyr's tree.

It is highly inadvisable to use the backslash in the names of your phases or cycles in Zephyr.
