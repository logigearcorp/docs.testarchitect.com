This section describes the requirements for setting up TestArchitect to develop tests in a TFS-MTM environment.

Within the TestArchitect ecosystem, the following software must be installed :

## The computer hosting the TestArchitect repository server

-   The TFS Object Model must exist. This package can be installed once you install Visual Studio. It may be installed as a stand-alone package. Note that if you decide to install the TFS Object Model as a stand-alone package, you must ensure that it is of the same version as your installed TFS. And also restart your repository server after installing the TFS Object Model.

## Computers hosting TestArchitect Client projects that are to be integrated with TFS-MTM need have no special software other than TestArchitect Client itself.

For full details on the hardware requirements of systems hosting TestArchitect Client or Repository Server, please refer to [System requirements](/TA_ReleaseNotes/DITA_source/System_Requirements.html).
