This section describes how to set up a TestArchitect project to allow for tests to be managed and exchanged with TFS. With your TA project integrated with TFS-MTM, you can import TFS test cases and test suites into TA and, conversely, upload TA test cases, test modules and test folders into TFS.

{{<note>}} To set up TestArchitect to allow for tests to be run from MTM, and/or have test results uploaded to TFS, see [Running automated tests under on-premises Team Foundation Server](/user-guide/integration-with-third-party-tools/tfs-integration/on-premises-tfs-environment-configuration/running-tests-under-on-premises-tfs/).

1.  [Team Foundation Server-Microsoft Test Manager prerequisites for TestArchitect](/user-guide/integration-with-third-party-tools/tfs-integration/on-premises-tfs-environment-configuration/authoring-test-procedures-under-on-premises-tfs/tfs-mtm-prerequisites-for-testarchitect)  
This section describes the requirements for setting up TestArchitect to develop tests in a TFS-MTM environment.
2.  [Configuring TestArchitect for a Team Foundation ServerÂ® connection](/user-guide/integration-with-third-party-tools/tfs-integration/on-premises-tfs-environment-configuration/authoring-test-procedures-under-on-premises-tfs/configuring-ta-for-a-tfs-connection)  
Establish a connection between TestArchitect and the Team Foundation Server \(TFS\) using an external tool provided by TestArchitect. \(Note that activating a connection to TFS automatically deactivates connections to other external tools such as HP Quality Center.\)
3.  [Mapping a TestArchitect project to a Team Foundation Server project](/user-guide/integration-with-third-party-tools/tfs-integration/on-premises-tfs-environment-configuration/authoring-test-procedures-under-on-premises-tfs/mapping-a-ta-project-to-a-tfs-project)  
Mapping a TA project to TFS team project allows you to upload test results to TFS.
4.  [Importing TFS test cases to TA](/user-guide/integration-with-third-party-tools/tfs-integration/on-premises-tfs-environment-configuration/authoring-test-procedures-under-on-premises-tfs/importing-tfs-test-cases)  
Test cases residing on TFS may be imported into TestArchitect, establishing one-to-one mappings between the two sets of test cases.
5.  [Importing Team Foundation Server test suites to TestArchitect](/user-guide/integration-with-third-party-tools/tfs-integration/on-premises-tfs-environment-configuration/authoring-test-procedures-under-on-premises-tfs/importing-tfs-test-suites)  
Just as TFS test cases may be imported, test suites residing in TFS may be also imported into TestArchitect.
6.  [Uploading TestArchitect test modules/test cases to Team Foundation Server](/user-guide/integration-with-third-party-tools/tfs-integration/on-premises-tfs-environment-configuration/authoring-test-procedures-under-on-premises-tfs/uploading-ta-test-modules-test-cases-to-tfs)  
TestArchitect test cases and test modules can be uploaded to the TFS server, which also establishes one-to-one mappings between the two sets of test cases.
