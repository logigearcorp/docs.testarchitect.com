The following topics discuss the tasks required to set up a TFS-MTM integrated environment, including setup of required Visual Studio components, and the TestArchitect plug-in.

The installation process is comprised of two parts:

-   installing the required Microsoft Application Lifecycle Management \(ALM\) components, and
-   configuring TestArchitect clients based on their roles â€“ specifically, [test development](/TA_Help/Topics/ug_MTM_set_up_TA.html) or [test execution](/TA_Help/Topics/ug_MTM_test_execution.html).

1.  [Installing and configuring Microsoft components for on-premises Team Foundation Server](/TA_Help/Topics/ug_MTM_configuration.html)  
This section and its subtopics list out a number of components of Microsoft's Application Lifecycle Management \(ALM\) environment that need to be installed and configured for on-premises TFS.
2.  [Authoring test procedures under Team Foundation Server](/TA_Help/Topics/ug_MTM_set_up_TA.html)  
This section describes how to set up a TestArchitect project to allow for tests to be managed and exchanged with TFS. With your TA project integrated with TFS-MTM, you can import TFS test cases and test suites into TA and, conversely, upload TA test cases, test modules and test folders into TFS.
3.  [Running automated tests under on-premises Team Foundation Server](/TA_Help/Topics/ug_MTM_test_execution.html)  
With TFS-MTM integration in place, you have the option of launching your automated TA tests from *either* environment. And in both cases, you can have your test results automatically \(or manually\) sent to TFS.
