This topic describes how to install and configure a test controller. You must install and configure at least one test controller for your team project collection, before you create a lab environment in that team project collection. When you configure a test controller for a lab environment, you have to register it with your team project collection.

Ensure that you have installed the supported components on your computer. \([Learn more](/TA_Help/Topics/ug_MTM_VS_components.html).\)

1.  Please refer to Microsoft's instructions on configuring and registering a test controller:

    -   Test controller for Microsoft Visual Studio 2017, 2015 \([learn more](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh546460(v=vs.140).aspx)\).
    -   Test controller for Microsoft Visual Studio [2013](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh546460(v=vs.120).aspx).
    Your test controller information should resemble the following once you have completed the configuration:
