After creating a build definition, the new build must be queued.

After creating and configuring a build definition \([learn more](ug_MTM_build_definition.html)\), run it to create a build instance to be associated with a test plan:

-   **[Queueing a new XAML build](/TA_Help/Topics/MTM_queue_XAML_build.html)**  
After creating an XML build definition, the new build must be queued.
-   **[Queueing a new TFBuild](/TA_Help/Topics/ug_MTM_queue_BuildVNext.html)**  
Once you've defined your build processes by creating a TFBuild definition, the new build definition must be queued.
