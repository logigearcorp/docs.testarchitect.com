To automate a TFS test case, you must link it to a test method in Visual Studio. You can link any unit test, coded UI test, or generic test to an TFS test case.

In this topic, for a quick demonstration, a test method of a coded UI test project \(CUIT\) is presented.

Please refer to Microsoft's instructions on creating a simple CUIT project.

-   Visual Studio [2017](https://almvm.azurewebsites.net/labs/tfs/codedui/).
-   Visual Studio [2015](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd286726.aspx#VerifyingCodeUsingCUITCreate).
-   Visual Studio [2013](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd286726(v=vs.120).aspx).

Suppose that you've created a working CUIT project. Your project contains test methods that may resemble the following image:

In the [following topic](ug_MTM_codedUI_association.html), these test methods are associated with TFS test cases.
