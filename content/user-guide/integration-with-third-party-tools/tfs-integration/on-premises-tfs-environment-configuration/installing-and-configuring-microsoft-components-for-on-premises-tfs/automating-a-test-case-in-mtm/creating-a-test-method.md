To automate a TFS test case, you must link it to a test method in Visual Studio. You can link any unit test, coded UI test, or generic test to an TFS test case.

In this topic, for a quick demonstration, a test method of a coded UI test project \(CUIT\) is presented.

Please refer to Microsoft's instructions on creating a simple CUIT project.

-   Visual Studio [2017](https://almvm.azurewebsites.net/labs/tfs/codedui/).
-   Visual Studio [2015](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd286726.aspx#VerifyingCodeUsingCUITCreate).
-   Visual Studio [2013](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd286726(v=vs.120).aspx).

Suppose that you've created a working CUIT project. Your project contains test methods that may resemble the following image:

In the [following topic](/user-guide/integration-with-third-party-tools/tfs-integration/on-premises-tfs-environment-configuration/installing-and-configuring-microsoft-components-for-on-premises-tfs/automating-a-test-case-in-mtm/associating-a-tfs-test-case-with-a-test-method), these test methods are associated with TFS test cases.
