Features of TestArchitect's TFS Bug Tracker tool.

-   **[TA bug information](/TA_Help/Topics/Bug_information_TFS.html)**  
Information regarding a TA bug is presented in two tabs. The **Information** tab contains general information about the bug. The **Related Items** tab lists those test modules whose execution exposes the bug.
-   **[Working with TFS attachments](/TA_Help/Topics/Bug_working_attachments_TFS.html)**  
You can attach files from TestArchitect to a TFS bug.
-   **[Submitting TestArchitect bugs to Team Foundation Server](/TA_Help/Topics/TFS_submitting_bug.html)**  
Submitting a bug from TestArchitect directly to a TFS server creates a new TFS bug on the server.
-   **[Adding Team Foundation Server - support fields to TestArchitect](/TA_Help/Topics/Bugs_defined_field_TFS.html)**  
Registered TA bugs, by default, have the fields **Summary**, **Description**, **Source** and **Status**, all of which can be kept in sync with the associated TFS bug. User-defined fields can be created in TestArchitect to accept values from other fields of a TFS bug.
-   **[Integrating Team Foundation Server and TestArchitect bug tracking](/TA_Help/Topics/Bugs_working_known_bug_TFS.html)**  
For tracking and resolving bugs, TFS and TestArchitect complement each other well.
