Features of TestArchitect's TFS Bug Tracker tool.

-   **[TA bug information](/user-guide/integration-with-third-party-tools/tfs-integration/tfs-bug-tracker/features-tfs-bug-tracker/ta-bug-information)**  
Information regarding a TA bug is presented in two tabs. The **Information** tab contains general information about the bug. The **Related Items** tab lists those test modules whose execution exposes the bug.
-   **[Working with TFS attachments](/user-guide/integration-with-third-party-tools/tfs-integration/tfs-bug-tracker/features-tfs-bug-tracker/working-with-tfs-attachments/)**  
You can attach files from TestArchitect to a TFS bug.
-   **[Submitting TestArchitect bugs to Team Foundation Server](/user-guide/integration-with-third-party-tools/tfs-integration/tfs-bug-tracker/features-tfs-bug-tracker/submitting-testarchitect-bugs-to-team-foundation-server)**  
Submitting a bug from TestArchitect directly to a TFS server creates a new TFS bug on the server.
-   **[Adding Team Foundation Server - support fields to TestArchitect](/user-guide/integration-with-third-party-tools/tfs-integration/tfs-bug-tracker/features-tfs-bug-tracker/adding-team-foundation-server-support-fields-to-testarchitect)**  
Registered TA bugs, by default, have the fields **Summary**, **Description**, **Source** and **Status**, all of which can be kept in sync with the associated TFS bug. User-defined fields can be created in TestArchitect to accept values from other fields of a TFS bug.
-   **[Integrating Team Foundation Server and TestArchitect bug tracking](/user-guide/integration-with-third-party-tools/tfs-integration/tfs-bug-tracker/features-tfs-bug-tracker/integrating-team-foundation-server-and-testarchitect-bug-tracking)**  
For tracking and resolving bugs, TFS and TestArchitect complement each other well.
