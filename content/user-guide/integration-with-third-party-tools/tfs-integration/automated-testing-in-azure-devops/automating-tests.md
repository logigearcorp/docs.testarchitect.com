The procedure for test management and test automation in Azure DevOps is almost the same as that in TFS web portal.

## Preconditioning  

-   You are familiar with Azure DevOps, particularly in build definition, release definition and test run.
-   You have a TA-TFS plug-in based solution to execute tests in your repository.

## Creating a build definition and queuing a build  

1.  In Azure DevOps, open the desired project.
2.  Select **Pipelines** and then **Builds** in the Navigation bar.
3.  The next steps are similar to those of [create a build definition and queue a build](/user-guide/integration-with-third-party-tools/tfs-integration/automated-testing-in-tfs-web-portal/creating-a-build-definition-and-queuing-a-build) in the TFS web portal.

## Creating a release definition  

1.  Select **Pipelines** and then **Releases** in the Navigation bar.
2.  The next steps are similar to those of [create a release definition](/user-guide/integration-with-third-party-tools/tfs-integration/automated-testing-in-tfs-web-portal/creating-a-release-definition) in the TFS web portal.

## Running automated tests  

Refer to [Running automated tests](/user-guide/integration-with-third-party-tools/tfs-integration/automated-testing-in-tfs-web-portal/running-automated-tests) in the TFS web portal.
