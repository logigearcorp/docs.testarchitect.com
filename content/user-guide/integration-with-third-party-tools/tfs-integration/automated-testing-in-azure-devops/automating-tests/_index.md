The procedure for test management and test automation in Azure DevOps is almost the same as that in TFS web portal.

## Preconditioning

-   You are familiar with Azure DevOps, particularly in build definition, release definition and test run.
-   You have a TA-TFS plug-in based solution to execute tests in your repository.

## Creating a build definition and queuing a build

1.  In Azure DevOps, open the desired project.
2.  Select **Pipelines** and then **Builds** in the Navigation bar.
3.  The next steps are similar to those of [create a build definition and queue a build](TFS_web_creating_and_queuing_build.html) in the TFS web portal.

## Creating a release definition

1.  Select **Pipelines** and then **Releases** in the Navigation bar.
2.  The next steps are similar to those of [create a release definition](TFS_web_creating_release_def.html) in the TFS web portal.

## Running automated tests

Refer to [Running automated tests](TFS_web_runnning_automated_tests.html) in the TFS web portal.
