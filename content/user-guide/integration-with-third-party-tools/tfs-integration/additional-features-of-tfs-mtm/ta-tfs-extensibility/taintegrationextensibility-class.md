The TAIntegrationExtensibility class provides template methods required for writing extensibility code for TA-TFS.

The TAIntegrationExtensibility class is generated in the Solution Explorer tree of your Visual Studio project, once you [create a TA-TFS project](/user-guide/integration-with-third-party-tools/tfs-integration/on-premises-tfs-environment-configuration/running-tests-under-on-premises-tfs/creating-ta-tfs-projects).

{{<remember>}}

-   If you created a TA-TFS project in earlier versions of TestArchitect – that is, prior to version [8.2 Update 3](/user-guide/version-history/features-added-to-testarchitect-8-2-update-3/windows) – your project does not contain the TAIntegrationExtensibility class.
-   In order to have this class included in your project, you must [upgrade the build assemblies of the TA plug-in](/user-guide/integration-with-third-party-tools/tfs-integration/additional-features-of-tfs-mtm/upgrading-build-assemblies-of-the-ta-plug-in/). Once the project is successfully upgraded, the TAIntegrationExtensibility class is available for editing.
