The TA-TFS Extensibility feature offers you, by means of TestArchitect-supported API methods, the ability to extend and customize the environment for executing automated test cases.

For example, you may customize TA-TFS to allow a given test run to include test cases distributed across multiple repositories. The supported API methods are all declared in the TAIntegrationExtensibility class, generated during TA-TFS project creation.
