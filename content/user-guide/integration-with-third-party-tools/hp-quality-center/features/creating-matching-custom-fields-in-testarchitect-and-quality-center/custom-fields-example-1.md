This example demonstrates the steps involved in mapping a custom field in TestArchitect to a custom field in the Quality Center **TEST** table.

1.  Create a user-defined field in TestArchitect \(for example, the field **OS**, with Value Type = Single line text and the **Default Value** set to xp\).

2.  Create a custom field in the Quality Center TEST table \(for example, **label = OS**, **Type = String**, **Required** check box unselected\).

3.  In TestArchitect, upload a test module \(for example, CalculationTM\) to Quality Center \(see [Uploading TestArchitect test modules/test cases to Quality Center](/user-guide/integration-with-third-party-tools/hp-quality-center/features/uploading-testarchitect-test-modules-test-cases-to-quality-center/)\).

4.  In Quality Center, confirm that the custom field **OS** holds the value **xp**.
