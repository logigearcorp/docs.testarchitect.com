Integration between TestArchitect™ and the Eclipse™ enhances testing and the debugging of user-scripted actions in Eclipse.

**Important:** Since TestArchitect version [8.3](/TA_ReleaseNotes/DITA_source/Whats_New_Windows_8.3.html), the TestArchitect Eclipse plug-in works with JDK versions from 1.8.0 to [1.8.0\_91](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/8u91-relnotes-2949462.html).

**Restriction:** Integration between TestArchitect™ and the Eclipse™ has been deprecated since TestArchitect version [8.3 Update 2](/TA_ReleaseNotes/DITA_source/Whats_New_8.3_update_2.html).
