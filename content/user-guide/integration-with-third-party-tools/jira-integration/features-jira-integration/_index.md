Features of TestArchitect's JIRA integration tool.

1.  [TA bug information](/user-guide/integration-with-third-party-tools/jira-integration/features-jira-integration/ta-bug-information)  
Information regarding a TA bug is presented in two tabs. The **Information** tab contains general information about the bug. The **Related Items** tab lists those test modules whose execution exposes the bug.
2.  [Working with JIRA attachments](/user-guide/integration-with-third-party-tools/jira-integration/features-jira-integration/working-with-jira-attachments/)  
You can attach files from TestArchitect to a JIRA bug.
3.  [Submitting TestArchitect bugs to JIRA server](/user-guide/integration-with-third-party-tools/jira-integration/features-jira-integration/submitting-testarchitect-bugs-to-jira-server)  
Submitting a bug from TestArchitect directly to a JIRA server creates a new JIRA bug on the server.
4.  [Adding JIRA-support fields to TestArchitect](/user-guide/integration-with-third-party-tools/jira-integration/features-jira-integration/adding-jira-support-fields-to-testarchitect)  
Registered TA bugs, by default, have the fields **Summary**, **Description**, **Source** and **Status**, all of which can be kept in sync with the associated JIRA bug. User-defined fields can be created in TestArchitect to accept values from other fields of a JIRA bug.
5.  [Integrating JIRA and TestArchitect bug tracking](/user-guide/integration-with-third-party-tools/jira-integration/features-jira-integration/integrating-jira-and-testarchitect-bug-tracking)  
For tracking and resolving bugs, JIRA and TestArchitect complement each other well.
