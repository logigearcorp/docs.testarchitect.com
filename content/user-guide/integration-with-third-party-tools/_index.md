TestArchitect seamlessly integrates with several powerful third-party tools, to assist in application development, continuous integration, test management, and bug tracking. Interfaces with HP Quality Center®, Team Foundation Server-Microsoft Test Manager®, Jenkins®, JIRA®, and Zephyr® are all available to extend TestArchitect's functionality and empower your and your team.

1.  [Working with Eclipse](/user-guide/integration-with-third-party-tools/working-with-eclipse/)  
Integration between TestArchitect™ and the Eclipse™ enhances testing and the debugging of user-scripted actions in Eclipse.
2.  [HP Quality Center](/user-guide/integration-with-third-party-tools/hp-quality-center/)  
TestArchitect's Quality Center integration solution allows for test designs to be seamlessly imported from Quality Center, and for tests and test results to be uploaded to it, minimizing the manual workload.
3.  [Team Foundation Server integration](/user-guide/integration-with-third-party-tools/tfs-integration/)  
TestArchitect™ can be integrated into Team Foundation Server \(TFS\)® allowing you to include your TestArchitect tests in your application’s lifecycle managed by the Visual Studio and Visual Studio Team Foundation tools. You can associate your TestArchitect test cases with TFS test cases in your test plan and run the plan as an automated test in MTM.
4.  [Continuous integration \(CI\) tools](/user-guide/integration-with-third-party-tools/continuous-integration-ci-tools/)  
To enable integration between TestArchitect and a continuous integration \(CI\) tool, an xUnit-format XML file must be imported into the tool. This XML file is created by extracting the test result of one or more test modules executed by TestArchitect.
5.  [JIRA integration](/user-guide/integration-with-third-party-tools/jira-integration/)  
TestArchitect™ can be integrated with JIRA®, a defect tracking system, allowing you and your team to easily keep track of JIRA bug issues by associating them with TestArchitect bugs.
6.  [Zephyr integration](/user-guide/integration-with-third-party-tools/zephyr-integration/)  
Zephyr® is a powerful end-to-end test management tool that complements the test creation and automation capabilities of TestArchitect™. LogiGear provides an integration solution for Zephyr to harness the full potential of both TestArchitect and Zephyr.
7.  [LDAP overview](/user-guide/integration-with-third-party-tools/ldap-overview/)  
TestArchitect's support for LDAP \(Lightweight Directory Access Protocol\) allows your TestArchitect login credentials to be established through your system account, avoiding the need for a separate sign on.
