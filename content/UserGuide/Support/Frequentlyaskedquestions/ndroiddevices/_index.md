# Unable to use the Interface Viewer's Auto Highlight tool on Android devices {#task_b2y_4hx_qr .task}

If you are unable to use the Interface Viewer's Auto Highlight tool properly, it can be due to the fact that application notification of TestArchitect Automation Agent is turned off.

Carry out the following steps to activate the application notification:

1.  Go to the test device's Manage Applications utility:

    -   On a device with Android 4.0 or higher, the Manage Applications utility is available under **Settings** \> **Application manager**.
    -   On a device with Android version lower than 4.0, the Manage Applications utility is available under **Settings** \> **Applications** \> **Manage applications**.
2.  Scroll through the list and tap the TestArchitect Automation Agent application.

    The App info screen is displayed.

3.  Select the **Show notifications** check box, if it is in off state. \(This allows TestArchitect Automation Agent to start receiving notifications.\)
