# What is TestArchitect? {#concept.faq.what_is_ta .concept}

TestArchitect is a powerful test automation framework that allows teams to improve quality through better test coverage, while reducing time-to-market and reducing costs. Based on the Action Based Testingâ„¢ methodology, TestArchitect allows organizations to achieve a test automation level of 80-95%, while other tools typically only result in 20-25% test automation

With TestArchitect, everyone on the test team can focus on what they do best, and work in parallel with a new level of effectiveness:

-   Test engineers and business analysts design executable tests composed of reusable actions
-   Automation engineers use their programming skills to automate and maintain individual actions, rather than entire tests, resulting in far better maintainability and scalability.
-   Managers and test leads stay in control with customizable reporting and revision control.
