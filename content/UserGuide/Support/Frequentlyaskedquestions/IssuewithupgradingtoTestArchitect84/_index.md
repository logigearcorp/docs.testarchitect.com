# Issue with upgrading to TestArchitect 8.4 {#faq.ta8.4_upgrade_issue .reference}

## Problem {#section_ddt_c4x_k2b .section}

As I am upgrading TestArchitect from version 8.3 to 8.4, the error - COMAutomation.dll failed to register - occurs. My TestArchitect 8.3 was previously from TestArchitect 8.1.

## Explanation { .section}

The problem happens because TestArchitect cannot find COMAutomation.dll. However, it has a negligible effect on your upgrading process. You don't need to take any action but ignore it. Click the **OK** button so that the upgrade can continue.
