# TA property {#gl.glossary_entry_TA_property .glossentry}

A named property that TestArchitect automatically assigns to a GUI control \(or HTML element\) of the AUT during [intake](glossaryWindowIntake.html). A captured control typically has several TA properties, along with their assigned values, derived from the control's [native properties](glossaryNativeProperty.html).

TA properties are classified into two types:

-   [primary properties](glossaryPrimaryProperty.html), in which the assigned value is derived more or less directly from a given native property; and
-   [secondary properties](glossarySecondaryProperty.html), in which the assigned value is calculated or algorithmically derived, and often based on more than one native property.
