# asynchronous remote execution {#gl.glossary_entry_asynchronous_remote_execution .glossentry}

Execution mode in which a given test run set is executed concurrently on multiple hardware targets, which may be desktop machines or mobile devices.

Asynchronous remote execution is set up in TestArchitect Client via the Controllers/Devices panel of the Execute Test dialog box. Note that, when generating a batch file, asynchronous remote execution is implemented by the creation of a separate TACommandLine command for each designated hardware target.
