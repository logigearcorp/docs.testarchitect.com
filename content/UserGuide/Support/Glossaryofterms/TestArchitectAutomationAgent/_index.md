# TestArchitect Automation Agent {#gl.ta_automation_agent .glossentry}

A browser extension that allows automated web testing to be conducted by TestArchitect. The extension is automatically installed in existing \(Chrome, Firefox, and Internet Explorer\) browsers on a given machine during TestArchitect installation. Post-installation, it may also be installed in a newly introduced browser by means of TestArchitect's [Automation Agent Manager](../../TA_Help/Topics/Test_exec_automation_agent_manager.html).

Also referred to as: **TA Automation Agent**.

**Note:** Do not confuse with [TestArchitect Agent](glossaryTAAgent.html), which is used for mobile testing, nor with [TestArchitect agent license](glossaryTAAgentLicense.html), which grants rights to the TestArchitect Controller service.
