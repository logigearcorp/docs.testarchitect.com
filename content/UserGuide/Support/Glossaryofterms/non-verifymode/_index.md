# non-verify mode {#gl.nonverify_mode .glossentry}

A mode set by the built-in [verify picture](../../TA_Automation/Topics/bis_verify_picture.html) setting. Under non-verify mode, the display of unverified picture checks produced during a test run is suppressed at the end of the run. Instead, user may manually retrieve unverified picture checks relating to the test run at any later time, in order to resolve their respective Pass, Fail, or Warning statuses.
