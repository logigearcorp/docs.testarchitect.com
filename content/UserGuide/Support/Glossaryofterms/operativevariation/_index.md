# operative variation {#gl.glossary_entry_version_compilation_order .glossentry}

The specific variation of a given project item that, at compile time, is ultimately selected by TestArchitect as the one that most closely matches the requirements of the runtime variation specification. This is the variation that, during the test, is to be invoked whenever the test requires that particular project item.
