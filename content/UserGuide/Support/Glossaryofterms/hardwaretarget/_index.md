# hardware target {#gl.glossary_entry_hardware_target .glossentry}

General term used to refer to the hardware platform on which a tested application is running. Note that, in desktop application and web testing, the hardware target, also known as test platform, refers to the same machine that hosts the [test controller](glossaryController.html). By contrast, in mobile testing, the target hardware is a separate machine, but is physically connected to the controller host.

Also referred to as: **test machine**, **test platform**.
