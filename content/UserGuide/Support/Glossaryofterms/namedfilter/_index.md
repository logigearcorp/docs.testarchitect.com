# named filter {#gl.glossary_entry_named_filter .glossentry}

A set of filter criteria specified with the built-in [filter](../../TA_Automation/Topics/bia_filter.html) action and assigned a name. This name may later be referenced \(by the [use data set](../../TA_Automation/Topics/bia_use_data_set.html) or [use filter](../../TA_Automation/Topics/bia_use_filter.html) action\) so as to apply the filter to incoming data for a test, eliminating rows not matching the criteria. \(See also [Named filters](../../TA_Tutorials/Topics/Named_data_set_filters.html)\).
