# verify mode {#gl.verify_mode .glossentry}

A mode set by the built-in [verify picture](../../TA_Automation/Topics/bis_verify_picture.html) setting. Under verify mode, unverified picture checks produced during a test run are automatically displayed in sequence at the end of the run, allowing a user to manually resolve the Pass, Fail, or Warning status of each.
