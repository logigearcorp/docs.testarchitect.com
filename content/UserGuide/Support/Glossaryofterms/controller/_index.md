The process, implemented by TestArchitect Controller software, responsible for managing the execution of automated tests. In the case of desktop or web application testing, the controller manages a single automation process and resides on the [test platform](glossaryHardwareTarget.html). In mobile testing, one or multiple devices may be physically connected to the controller host, which manages the test executions on each device concurrently.

Also referred to as: **test controller**.
