# action, application-level {#gl.action_high_level .glossentry}

An interaction with the interface of the application under test, described in the most general terms possible, so that it may be readily understood even by a user who has not yet seen the program, and without specifying the detailed steps necessary to complete that action.

As an example, the application-level action login might contain several [system-level actions](glossaryLowLevelAction.html) such as enter and click, in order to accomplish the multi-step task of successfully logging a user into an application.
