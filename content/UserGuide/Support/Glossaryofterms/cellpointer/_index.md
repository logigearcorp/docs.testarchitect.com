# cell pointer {#gl.glossary_entry_cell_pointer .glossentry}

In the TestArchitect editor, the cell pointer indicates the currently-focused cell of the worksheet â€“ that is, the cell into which text is entered when you start typing \(assuming the file is in an editable state\). The cell pointer itself is a black border surrounding the cell:

**Note:** The distinction should be understood between the cell pointer and text cursor. The text cursor is the vertical flashing bar that appears while the focused cell is in a text-entry state, and indicates exactly where in the cell's contents the next typed character will appear.
