# Exporting actions {#Actions_export .task}

A user-defined action can be exported to an archive file \(.ZIP format\), which can be used as a backup or for reimporting.

Choose one of the following two methods to export user-defined actions:

-   **Option 1**:

    1.  In the TestArchitect explorer tree, right-click a user-defined action node, then click **Export to ZIP file**.

    2.  In the Export Action dialog box, click ![](../Images/btn.browse-ellipsis.01.png) to choose a location to which to save the file \(in .ZIP format\).

        **Tip:** You can accept the default location, but any place that is easy to remember will work.

    3.  Click **OK**.

-   **Option 2**:

    1.  Double-click the **Actions** node in the TestArchitect explorer tree

    2.  In the action list view, right-click the action that you want to export, then click **Export to ZIP file**.

    3.  In the Export Action dialog box, click ![](../Images/btn.browse-ellipsis.01.png) to choose a location to which to save the file \(in .ZIP format\).

        **Tip:** You can accept the default location, but any place that is easy to remember will work.

    4.  Click **OK**.


The action archive file \(.ZIP\) is exported to the specified location.
