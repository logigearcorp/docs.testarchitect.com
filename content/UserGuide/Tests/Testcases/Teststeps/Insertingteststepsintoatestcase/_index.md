# Inserting test steps into a test case {#task_zyx_zbc_hm .task}

If the **Automatically insert step to test case** check box in Preferences is currenty cleared, you can manually insert test steps into a test case.

To insert test steps into a test case, perform the following steps:

1.  Select a cell in the `TEST CASE` area which contains the newly created test steps \(column A\).

2.  Type [step](../../TA_Automation/Topics/bia_step.html) and press Enter on your keyboard.

    TestArchitect's auto-complete functionality suggests possible test step names as you type.

3.  Select the desire test step in the drop-down list box.


The expected result of the selected test step is inserted to the next cell.
