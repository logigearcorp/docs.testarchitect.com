# ACTION BASED TESTING {#ABT_TM .concept}

Action Based Testing is an example of a keyword-based methodology, as described previously.

Action Based Testing is based on test module elements, which are essentially workbooks comprising the following sections:

-   objectives
-   test cases
-   actions with arguments
-   interface handling, including:
    -   interfaces
    -   interface entities
    -   interface elements
-   data-driven testing, using data sets

1.  [Test Modules](../../TA_Help/Topics/ABT_Test_module.html)  
All test development and execution in Action Based Testing is based on test modules.
2.  [Actions](../../TA_Help/Topics/ABT_actions.html)  
An action is a reusable container housing a series of operations and checks.
3.  [Interface definitions](../../TA_Help/Topics/ABT_interface_def.html)  
An automated test execution needs to interact with the application under test through one or more interfaces.
4.  [Data-driven testing](../../TA_Help/Topics/ABT_data_driven_testing.html)  
In Action Based Testing, action-based tests can be applied to data sets.
