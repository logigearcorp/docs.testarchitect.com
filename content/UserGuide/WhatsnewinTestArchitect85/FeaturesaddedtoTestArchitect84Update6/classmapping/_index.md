# class mapping {#gl.glossary_entry_class_mapping .glossentry}

The assignment of TA classes to controls of an AUT, based on their respective native control classes. Class mapping is performed during [intake](../../TA_Help/Topics/Interface_def_intake.html), using mapping tables built into TestArchitect, and optionally user-created mappings as well.
