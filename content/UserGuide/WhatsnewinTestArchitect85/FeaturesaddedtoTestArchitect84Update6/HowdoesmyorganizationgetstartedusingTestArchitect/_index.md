A TestArchitect license includes installation, setup, and initial training. If your key people have an understanding of keyword-driven testing you should be good-to-go. Many organizations choose to participate in the Action Based Testing "ABT Jumpstart" program, which is a 1-2 week program of consulting, implementation, and informal training sessions. In ABT Jumpstart, LogiGear's experienced consultants will work onsite with your staff to lay the groundwork for your test automation effort. At the end of the program, your entire team will be familiar with using TestArchitect and the Action Based Testing method to design and automate tests.
