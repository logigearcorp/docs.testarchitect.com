# node-locked license {#gl.node_locked_license .glossentry}

A license type that is available for TestArchitect [Universal](glossaryTAUniversal.html) licenses. Under the node-locked system, a license is dedicated to a particular host, and not relinquished when TestArchitect is inactive on that host. As with host-based licenses, a node-locked license may be transferred between machines, except that more restrictions apply.
