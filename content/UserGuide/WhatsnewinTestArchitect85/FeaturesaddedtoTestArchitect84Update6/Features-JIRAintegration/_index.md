# Features - JIRA integration {#concept_y32_knj_mn .concept}

Features of TestArchitect's JIRA integration tool.

1.  [TA bug information](../../TA_Help/Topics/Bug_information.html)  
Information regarding a TA bug is presented in two tabs. The **Information** tab contains general information about the bug. The **Related Items** tab lists those test modules whose execution exposes the bug.
2.  [Working with JIRA attachments](../../TA_Help/Topics/Bug_working_attachments.html)  
You can attach files from TestArchitect to a JIRA bug.
3.  [Submitting TestArchitect bugs to JIRA server](../../TA_Help/Topics/JIRA_submitting_bug.html)  
Submitting a bug from TestArchitect directly to a JIRA server creates a new JIRA bug on the server.
4.  [Adding JIRA-support fields to TestArchitect](../../TA_Help/Topics/Bugs_defined_field_TA.html)  
Registered TA bugs, by default, have the fields **Summary**, **Description**, **Source** and **Status**, all of which can be kept in sync with the associated JIRA bug. User-defined fields can be created in TestArchitect to accept values from other fields of a JIRA bug.
5.  [Integrating JIRA and TestArchitect bug tracking](../../TA_Help/Topics/Bugs_working_known_bug_JIRA.html)  
For tracking and resolving bugs, JIRA and TestArchitect complement each other well.
