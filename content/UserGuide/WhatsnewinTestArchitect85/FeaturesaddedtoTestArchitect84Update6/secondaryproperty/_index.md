# secondary property {#glossentry_byz_svy_yq .glossentry}

A [TA property](glossaryTAProperty.html) whose value is not taken directly from that of a native property of a given UI element. Instead, the value may be determined algorithmically based on one or more native properties of the element, or possibly based on properties of neighboring elements.
