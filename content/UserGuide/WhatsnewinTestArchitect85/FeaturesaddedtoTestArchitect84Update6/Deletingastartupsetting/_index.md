# Deleting a startup setting {#task_ljl_vxc_jt .task}

You can delete startup settings of both user-defined and built-in settings.

From TestArchitect Client's Execute Test dialog box, you can delete the startup settings that will be used in [client-directed test runs](../../TA_Glossary/Topics/glossaryClientDirectedExecution.html) as well as batch files. Note that deleting a user-defined setting from the **Startup Settings** tab is effectively removing the setting from existence. By contrast, a built-in setting cannot be deleted â€“ deleting its startup setting simply ensures that each test module in the test run begins execution with that built-in setting set to its system default value.

1.  Launch the [Execute Test](../../TA_Help/Topics/Test_exec_test_execution.html) dialog box.

2.  Select the **Startup Settings** tab.

3.  From the **Startup Settings** list, select a setting you would like to remove, and then click **Remove**.

4.  Click **Yes** to confirm the deletion.


The startup setting is removed from the **Startup Settings** list of that repository.
