# Results Comparison page {#Test_result_baseline_result .reference}

The Result comparison page which is available on a web browser displays the differences, side-by-side, between two test results at checkpoints defined in the test procedure.

## Results Comparison {#sect_e383h_k3e8 .section}

The Results Comparison HTML page, as illustrated in the images below, displays the typical checkpoint output when two test results are compared. There are two tabs including **Summary** and **Comparison Details**.

![](../Images/Result_comparison_dialog_new.png "Summary tab")

Checks passed
:   The number of checks that passed in the baseline test, and passed in the recent test.

New fails
:   The number of checks that passed in the baseline test, but failed in the recent test.

Known fails
:   The number of checks that failed in the baseline test, and failed in the recent test.

Resolved fails
:   The number of checks that failed in the baseline test, but passed in the recent test.

-   Individual test cases may be hidden or shown by clicking the **\[-\]** or **\[+\]** icons in the headers.
-   To quickly collapse/expand all test case nodes in the **Comparison Details** tab, click the **Collapse All/Expand all** button.
-   By default, ten checkpoint items are displayed per page in the **Comparison Details** tab. To display more or fewer items, select a desired value from the **Display** drop-down list.
-   The drop-down list, next to the **Expand All** button, offers you various options for displaying results:

    Show all
    :   Displays comparisons of all checkpoints, regardless of the results.

    Show different check\(s\) only
    :   Displays the checks that either failed in the baseline, but now passed in the test, or vice versa.

    Show new fail\(s\) only
    :   Displays the checks that passed in the baseline test, but failed in the recent test.

    Show resolved fail\(s\)
    :   Displays the checks that failed in the baseline test, but passed in the recent test.

    Show different errors/warnings
    :   Displays the checks that passed with warning/error status.


## Comparing serial run results {#sect_nd6h_kd83 .section}

If the baseline test result is a set of serial test results, an additional Comparing Multiple Paris of Results dialog box appears to show the differences between pairs of results.

To view a detailed comparison of a pair of results generated by the same test module:

1.  Select the row containing the test module of interest.
2.  Click the **View** button. The Results Comparison HTML page appears.

    **Note:** A detailed description of the Result Comparison page is discussed above.
