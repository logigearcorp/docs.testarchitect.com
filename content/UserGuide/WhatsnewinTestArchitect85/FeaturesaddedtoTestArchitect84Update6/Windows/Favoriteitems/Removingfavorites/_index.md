# Removing favorites {#task_hjd_yqg_4l .task}

Use the **Favorite** list view if you need to remove a favorite item or multiple favorite items at once.

To remove favorite items, follow these steps.

1.  Open the [favorites list view](Listview_favorites_opening.html).

2.  You can select a single favorite item or multiple favorite items by using the Shift or Control keys:

    -   One left-click to select a single favorite item.
    -   Shift + left-click to select a contiguous range of favorite items.
    -   Control + left-click to select multiple noncontiguous favorite items.
3.  Right-click the selection, and then click **Remove** from the context menu.

    **Tip:** You can also click the **Remove** button.

    The selected favorites are removed from the favorites list view.


**Note:** When you log in to a repository on another test machine with your account, all changes that you make to your favorite items will instantly show up on that test machine.
