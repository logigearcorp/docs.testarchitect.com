# Adding items to favorites {#favorite_items_adding .task}

Instead of memorizing favorite items, use TestArchitect Favorites to easily save items youâ€™d like to revisit.

The simplest way to add items to favorites is to click the ![](../Images/favorite.gif) icon in the toolbar. Some alternative ways to add items to favorites are:

-   Option \#1: Right-click an open tab you want to add as to favorite, and then click **Add active tab to favorites** option.

    **Tip:** To bookmark all open items at once, click **Add all open tabs to favorites**.

-   Option \#2: Add a favorite item from the toolbar.

    1.  Click the down arrow next to the ![](../Images/favorite.gif) icon in the toolbar to see your options.

        **Tip:** To bookmark all open items at once, click **Add all open tabs to favorites**.

-   Option \#3: Add all open all tabs at once from the favorite list view.

    1.  Open the [favorite list view](Listview_favorites_opening.html).

    2.  Click the **Add all open tabs to favorites** button.


**Note:** When you log in to a repository on another test machine with your account, all changes that you make to your favorite items will instantly show up on that test machine.
