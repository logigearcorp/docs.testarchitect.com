# Bug list view {#concept_kwk_1hx_1m .concept}

The Bug list view displays a list of all bug items including linked and unlinked bugs. Those bug items are contained in the **Bugs** node on the TestArchitect explorer tree.

On the TestArchitect explorer tree, when you double-click the [**Bugs**](Bugs.html) node, TestArchitect opens a list view of bugs in the main panel.

Here are features for using the Bug list view:

-   [**Searching**](Listview_filtering.html): Use filters to quickly find a bug within the list view.
-   [**Sorting**](Listview_field_sorting.html): Sort your bugs into alphabetical order.
-   **[Opening](Bug_opening.html)**: Multiple bugs can be opened quickly from the context menu.
-   **[Deleting](Bugs_deleting.html)**: Delete one or multiple bugs within the list view.
-   **[Viewing related items](Bugs.md#section_rkf_vtw_mn)**: View those test modules holding TestArchitect bugs.

**Tip:** To update the TA bug from the fields of its JIRA counterpart, click the **Refresh** button. Note, however, that a minimum interval of 60 seconds between refreshes is imposed for a given TestArchitect Client.
