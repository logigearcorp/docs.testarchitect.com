1.  If the TestArchitect Utility Server has not been started, carry out the following steps:

    1.  Open the TestArchitect Repository Server - Control Panel by double-clicking on the TestArchitect Repository Server icon on Windowsâ€™ notification area.

    2.  On the TestArchitect Repository Server - Control Panel main menu, select **Tools** \> **TestArchitect Utility Server Information**.

        **Note:** The TestArchitect Utility Server Information command is enabled only after the Repository Server has been started.

        The server information window opens:
