# Diff tool {#concept_n3l_yvb_cv .concept}

The TestArchitect Diff Tool offers you a visual and convenient means of determining the differences between two similar project items, or differences in the contents of similar TestArchitect explorer tree nodes or folders.

As a test author, you may at times find yourself in the position of needing to inspect two text-based project items that are related in some way, to compare them for their differences. You may also find it necessary to compare two similar TestArchitect explorer tree nodes or folders to understand how their contents differ, perhaps within a project or across projects, or even across repositories.

See the following topics for further information on using the TestArchitect Diff Tool:

-   [Comparing two project items of the same type](ug_item_comparison.html) .
-   [Comparing the contents of nodes and folders](ug_diff_tool_directory.html).
