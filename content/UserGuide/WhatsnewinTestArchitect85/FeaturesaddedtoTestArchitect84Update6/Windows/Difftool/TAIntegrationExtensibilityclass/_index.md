# TAIntegrationExtensibility class {#concept_y4m_txk_rs .concept}

The TAIntegrationExtensibility class provides template methods required for writing extensibility code for TA-TFS.

The TAIntegrationExtensibility class is generated in the Solution Explorer tree of your Visual Studio project, once you [create a TA-TFS project](Integration_MTM_creating_vs_project.html).

**Remember:**

-   If you created a TA-TFS project in earlier versions of TestArchitect – that is, prior to version [8.2 Update 3](../../TA_ReleaseNotes/DITA_source/Whats_New_8.2_update_3_Windows.html) – your project does not contain the TAIntegrationExtensibility class.
-   In order to have this class included in your project, you must [upgrade the build assemblies of the TA plug-in](ug_MTM_upgrading_assemblies.html). Once the project is successfully upgraded, the TAIntegrationExtensibility class is available for editing.
