# Search {#Additional_features_search .concept}

TestArchitect has a number of search commands available. You can find an item in the explorer tree, or a text string in files like test modules or action definitions.

1.  [Searching items in the TestArchitect explorer tree](../../TA_Help/Topics/ug_search_item.html)  
A search is conducted within a subtree of a project. The search is restricted to one particular item type \(test module, action, data set or interface entity, etc.\), and is limited to item names \(not item contents or metadata\).
2.  [Searching item content for text](../../TA_Help/Topics/ug_search_item_content.html)  
 In addition to item names, you can conduct searches of the text content of test modules, user-defined actions, data sets and interface entities.
