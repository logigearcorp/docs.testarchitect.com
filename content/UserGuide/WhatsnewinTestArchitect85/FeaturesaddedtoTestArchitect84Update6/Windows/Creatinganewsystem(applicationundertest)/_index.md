# Creating a new system \(application under test\) {#variations_create_linked_variations_new_system .task}

Create a new system tree to represent a given dimension of variability of an application under test, or of its environment.

To create a new system, do the following:

1.  In the TestArchitect explorer tree, right-click the **Systems & Platforms** node of your repository, then select **New System**.

    A new system node is created with a name automatically assigned.
