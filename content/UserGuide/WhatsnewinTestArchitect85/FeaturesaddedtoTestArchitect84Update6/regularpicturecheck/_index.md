# regular picture check {#gl.regular_picture_check .glossentry}

A picture check that is owned by a given test module, and available in TestArchitect Client through the **Picture Checks** subtab of the test module.

**Note:** TestArchitect can store a picture check as either a regular picture check or [shared picture check](glossarySharedPictureCheck.html). The two types vary in terms of where they are stored and their scope of availability. A regular picture check's availability is limited to the test module that it belongs to.
