# Dashboard pages {#Dashboard_pages .concept}

A Dashboard page acts as a container for one or more panels, arranged in columns, that display metrics about your tests and test projects.

The area on the upper-left hand side of the main Dashboard page shows the names of the Dashboard pages. Two default pages \(Overview and Execution Dashboard\) are displayed when you open a Dashboard for the first time.

The **Overview** page contains four default built-in panels showing general status of your project:

-   Test Module Implementation by Priority
-   Test Module Status per Assigned Users
-   Test Module Execution

The **Execution Dashboard** page has eight default built-in panels:

-   **Test Modules Execution Result Details by Dates**: Stacked bar chart displaying aggregate test results \(in terms of percentages of Passed/Failed/Passed with Warning/Error\) for all test modules in a given test folder, organized by date of run.
-   **Test Modules Execution Result Details by Build**: Stacked bar chart showing aggregate test results \(in terms of percentages of Passed/Failed/Passed with Warning/Error\) for all test modules in a given test folder, organized by **Build Number**.
-   **Test Modules Execution Failure Trend by Date**: Line chart displaying the total number of test module run failures for the modules of a given test folder over time, grouped by date.
-   **Test Modules Execution Failure Trend by Build**: Line chart displaying the total number of test module run failures for the modules of a given test folder, by **Build Number**.
-   **Test Modules Execution Results on Latest Build**: Pie chart displaying the relative proportions of Passed/Failed/Passed with Warning/Errorresults for all test runs with the latest **Build Number** of the test modules of a given test folder.
-   **Test Modules Execution Results on Linux**: Pie chart displaying the relative proportions of Passed/Failed/Passed with Warning/Errorresults for all Linux-targeted test runs of the modules of a given test folder.
-   **Test Modules Execution History by Build**: Heat map displaying test run results by test module, organized by **Build Number**.
-   **Test Modules Execution History by Date**: Heat map displaying test run results by test module, organized by run date.
