## Test Case display

**Note:** This discussion refers to the subtabs that are present under a named test case tab. \(It does not apply to the **Test Cases** subtab which appears under a named test module tab.\) You can access a named test case tab by expanding a test module node in the explorer tree, then double-clicking one of the test case subnodes, if any.

A test case is displayed in TestArchitect Client with the following subtabs:

-   **Steps**: A step-by-step guide to the test case's execution plan.
-   **Information**: Information fields for the test case.
-   **Test Objectives**: List of test objectives addressed by the selected test case.
-   **Related bugs**: List of the marked known bugs contained in the test case \(See [TestArchitect bugs](Bugs.html)\).

## Test Objective display

**Note:** This discussion refers to the subtabs that are present under a named test case tab. \(It does not apply to the **Test Cases** subtab which appears under a named test module tab.\) You can access a named test case tab by expanding a test module node in the explorer tree, then double-clicking one of the test case subnodes, if any.

A test case is displayed in TestArchitect Client with the following subtabs:

-   **Steps**: A step-by-step guide to the test case's execution plan.
-   **Information**: Information fields for the test case.
-   **Test Objectives**: List of test objectives addressed by the selected test case.
-   **Related bugs**: List of the marked known bugs contained in the test case \(See [TestArchitect bugs](Bugs.html)\).

## Data Set display

A data set is displayed in TestArchitect Client with two subtabs:

-   **Data Lines**: Worksheet-style test editor for developing and editing the data set.
-   **Information**: Information fields for the data set.

## Action Definition display

## Interface display

An interface is displayed in TestArchitect Client with two subtabs:

-   **Interface Entities**: List of interface entities defined for the interface.
-   **Information**: Information fields for the interface.

## Interface Entity display

-   **Information**: Information fields for the interface entity.

## Interface Element display

**Note:** Direct editing of interface elements is generally performed in the **Interface Lines** tab of the parent interface entity. Initial generation of interface elements is generally performed with the [Interface Viewer](Interface_def_Viewer.html) or [Identify tool](Interface_def_client_interface_tool_identify.html).

An interface element is displayed in TestArchitect Client with a single screen \(no tabs\) containing both information fields and the element definition fields.

**Tip:** This screen displays only the first property field for the interface element. If the element's definition involves more than a single property-value pair, the additional pairs must be accessed in the **Interface Lines** tab of the parent interface entity.
