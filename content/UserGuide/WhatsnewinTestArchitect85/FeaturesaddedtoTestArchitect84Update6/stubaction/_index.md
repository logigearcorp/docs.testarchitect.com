# stub action {#gl.glossary_entry_stub_action .glossentry}

A user-defined action that has been defined only in terms of its name and possibly its arguments as well, without any internal action lines. A stub action serves as a convenience to anyone referencing it in the test editor, who will see that the action is defined, and also finds the calling action line automatically populated with the correct argument headers.

A stub action may serve as a placeholder for a user-defined action to be created at a later time. It may also function as a “front end” for a [user-scripted action](glossaryScriptedAction.html), given that such actions cannot automatically make themselves known to the editor.
