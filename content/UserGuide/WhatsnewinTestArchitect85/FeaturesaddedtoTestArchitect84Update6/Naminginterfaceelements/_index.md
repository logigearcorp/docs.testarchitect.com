# Naming interface elements {#Interface_def_naming .concept}

In order to refer to an interface element, an action needs a TA name \(also called a logical name\) for that element. Choosing good logical names is an essential step in the design of your automation.

## Naming interface elements

A logical name should:

-   be readable by a human reader,
-   not have to change due to changes in the application under test.

**Restriction:** The following special characters are not allowed in TA names: **\\** **/ : \* ? " ' < \> \| \# \[ \]**
