# GUI element {#gl.glossary_entry_GUI_element .glossentry}

Any component of the graphical user interface \(GUI\) of an application. This includes windows, dialog boxes, web pages, controls \(such as buttons, text boxes, menus\) and HTML elements.

**Note:** Note that, despite containing the word *element*, \(which, in the contexts of HTML web pages and TestArchitect interfaces, suggests a narrower set of GUI structures\), the term *GUI element* connotes the full range of classes of graphical user interface components.
