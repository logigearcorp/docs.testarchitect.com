# Exporting test results to XML {#Test_result_export_XML .task}

How to export a detailed test results report to an XML file.

Choose one of the following two methods to export test results to XML:

-   **Option 1**: Manually exporting test results to XML.

    1.  Select the test results that you want to export to an XML file.

        **Tip:** You can select test results on the TestArchitect explorer tree, or on the [result list view](Listview_results.html).

    2.  Right-click the selection, then select **Export** \> **to XML Detail** .

    3.  In the Save dialog box, choose a location to which to save the XML file.

        **Tip:** You can accept the default location, but any place that is easy to remember will work.

    4.  Click **Save**.

        The test results are exported to an XML file at the designated location.

-   **Option 2**: Exporting to XML automatically after test completion.

    1.  Select the test module\(s\) that you want to execute.

    2.  Click the **Execute** ![](../Images/btn.TAC_toolbar.Execute.png) button on the toolbar.

    3.  In the Execute Test dialog box, click the Advanced Setting tab.

    4.  Select the **Export result\(s\) to XML detail** check box.

    5.  Click ![](../Images/btn.browse-ellipsis.01.png) to choose a location to which to save the XML file.

        **Tip:** You can accept the default location, but any place that is easy to remember will work.

    6.  Click **Execute**.

        TestArchitect saves the settings on the Advanced Setting tab and executes the test\(s\). Once execution is complete, the test results are automatically exported to an XML file in standard XML format at the specified location.
