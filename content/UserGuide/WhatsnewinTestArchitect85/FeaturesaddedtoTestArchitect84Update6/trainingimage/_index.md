# training image {#gl.training_image .glossentry}

A bitmap image, generally captured from the display of the AUT, used for establishing optimal settings for certain image-related functions.

In TestArchitect, training images are used to manually establish optimum settings for both picture handling actions \(ones that employ key point image detection\), and OCR actions.
