# Boolean {#gl.glossary_entry_Boolean .glossentry}

A Boolean outcome or data type is one whose domain has two possible values. Typically, these are expressed as true/false, yes/no, 1/0 or, especially in the case of test automation, pass/fail. In TestArchitect, some action arguments are Boolean. Moreover, the results of all if..., does..., is... and check... actions are all determined by conditions whose outcomes are Boolean.
