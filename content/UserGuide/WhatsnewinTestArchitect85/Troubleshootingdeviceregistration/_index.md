# Troubleshooting device registration {#reference_mqz_t2g_2l .reference}

This topic lists typical issues you may experience when registering devices to a Lab Manager session, and offers possible solutions.

**You do not see the desired device on the Add new Device dialog box**

If you do not see the device you want to register in Lab Manger, there are two most likely reasons:

1.  The device is not connected to its host controller.

    Check the connection between the device and its host controller, and then reattempt to register that device in your Lab Manager session.

2.  The desired device is already registered to your Lab Manager session.
