# Features added to TestArchitect 8 Update 3 {#concept_what_new_8_U3 .concept}

This topic describes the changes made in TestArchitect version 8 update 3.

**Remember:**

-   Before upgrading to the latest version of TestArchitect, it is strongly recommended that you back up all repositories.
-   A TestArchitect client and any repository server to which it connects must be of the same version.
-   When installing TestArchitect, make sure that both the components TestArchitect Client and Repository Server are selected; this is essential to ensuring that the Interface Viewer can detect Silverlight controls.

-   [**Support for Silverlight**](../../TA_Automation/Topics/aut_app_testing_Silverlight_apps.html): Silverlight now joins the family of development platforms supported by TestArchitect, allowing you to design and execute automated tests of Silverlight applications.

        -   Silverlight version 5.
    -   Supported Silverlight application types and modes:
        -   In-browser applications.
        -   Out-of-browser applications \(that is, Silverlight applications deployed on a local computer\).
        -   HTTPS protocol communication.
        -   Windowless mode \(in which a Silverlight plug-in's content is displayed directly in the browser window, rather than in a separate rendering window\).

        -   Internet Explorer versions 10 or 11, 32- and 64-bit versions.
    -   Supported desktop operating systems:

**Note:** Silverlight is a powerful development tool for creating engaging, interactive user experiences for Web and mobile applications. Silverlight is a free plug-in, powered by the .NET framework and compatible with multiple browsers, devices and operating systems, bringing a new level of interactivity wherever the Web works.
