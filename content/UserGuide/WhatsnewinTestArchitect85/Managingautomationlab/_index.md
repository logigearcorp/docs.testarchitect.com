# Managing automation lab {#Lab_manager_Managing_automation_lab .concept}

A Lab Manager session displays and monitors all those TestArchitect controllers that are registered to the session.

One should note that, while a Lab Manager session may monitor any number of controllers, a controller may be registered to only one Lab Manager session at any given time.

Registration may be handled from either end: that is, you may register a controller to a Lab Manager session from within Lab Manager, or self-register the controller, which means, perform the registration from the controller itself.

1.  [Lab Manager toolbar](../../TA_Help/Topics/Lab_manager_toolbar.html)  
The Lab Manager toolbar consists of several buttons for managing the controllers/devices, test runs, and the display.

How to register a controller from Lab Manager.
3.  [Self-registering a controller](../../TA_Help/Topics/Lab_manager_self_registering.html)  
A controller can register itself with a Lab Manager session.
4.  [Special note regarding porting virtual machine images](../../TA_Help/Topics/Lab_manager_notes.html)  
Lab Manager allows for the seamless transport of a cloned controller.
5.  [Registering devices](../../TA_Help/Topics/Lab_manager_registering_device.html)  
Registering a device from within a Lab Manager session.
6.  [Controller status](../../TA_Help/Topics/Lab_manager_controller.html)  
You can view, within a Lab Manager session, the current status of each registered controller, including the results of test runs \(both after-the-fact and in real time\) and other information. You can also abort tests on individual controllers, and remove controllers from the session.
7.  [Device status](../../TA_Help/Topics/Lab_manager_device.html)  
In a Lab Manager session, you can view the current status \(in real time or after-the-fact\) of each registered device, and mark devices for removal or test termination.
