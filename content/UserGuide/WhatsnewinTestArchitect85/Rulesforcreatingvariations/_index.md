# Rules for creating variations {#variations_rules .concept}

Rules for creating variations.

1.  [Linking to one system](../../TA_Help/Topics/Variations_rules_1.html)  
Each variation of a given project item definition must be linked to the same system, or to no system at all.
2.  [Linking to multiple versions](../../TA_Help/Topics/Variations_rules_2.html)  
A variation may be linked to only one system. However, that variation may be linked to multiple version nodes belonging to a single system.
3.  [Assigning a keyword signature to a variation](../../TA_Help/Topics/Variations_rules_3.html)  
A given variation is identified by its variation signature: the combination of the system versions it is linked to \(system signature\) and the keywords assigned to it \(keyword signature\). This topic discusses the keyword signature.
4.  [Uniqueness of effective variations](../../TA_Help/Topics/Variations_rules_4.html)  
For each effective variation of a given project item, the combination of version signature and keyword signature must be unique. TestArchitect enforces that uniqueness when you create new variations.
