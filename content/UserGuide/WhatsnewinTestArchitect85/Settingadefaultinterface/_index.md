# Setting a default interface {#Interface_def_set_default_interface .task}

The default interface in a project is the one that is in effect during a test if no other interface has been specified for the test. \(Typically, however, a test initializes itself with the use interface built-in action to specify the interface to be used\).

Choose one of the following three methods to set a default interface:

-   **Option 1**:

    1.  Double-click the interface that you want to set as default.

        The list view of the selected interface appears.

    2.  Click the **Information** tab.

    3.  Select the **Default** check box.

    4.  Click **Apply**.

-   **Option 2**:

    1.  In the TestArchitect explorer tree, double-click the **Interfaces** node

        The interface list view appears in the main panel.

    2.  Select the **Default** radio button for the interface you wish to set as the default.

-   **Option 3**:

    1.  In the TestArchitect explorer tree, right-click the interface that you want to set as default.

    2.  From the context menu, select **Set as Default Interface**.


The icon for the interface that has been set as default displays a red horizontal bar across the top.
