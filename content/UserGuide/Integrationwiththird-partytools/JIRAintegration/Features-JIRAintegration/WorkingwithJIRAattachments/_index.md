# Working with JIRA attachments {#concept_ywx_3xw_fm .concept}

You can attach files from TestArchitect to a JIRA bug.

**Note:**

-   At present, TestArchitect-JIRA integration supports versions 5 and 6 of JIRA.

An attachment is any file that is included with your JIRA bug. Supported attachments are test results in HTML format and screenshots. You can attach files to any JIRA bug, provided you have permission to do so.

-   **[Attaching HTML test results to a JIRA bug](../../TA_Help/Topics/Bug_working_attachments_test_results.html)**  
TestArchitect allows you to attach both local results and repository results, in HTML format, to a JIRA bug.
