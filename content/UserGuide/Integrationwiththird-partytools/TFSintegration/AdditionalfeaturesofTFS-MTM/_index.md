# Additional features of TFS-MTM {#concept_ax3_t3h_2s .concept}

A discussion of additional key features of TestArchitect and TFS-MTM integration.

1.  [Disassociating TestArchitect and Team Foundation Server test cases in Visual Studio](../../TA_Help/Topics/ug_MTM_disassociate.html)  
When you no longer want to keep the association, you can disassociate TestArchitect tests from TFS tests.
2.  [Creating matching custom fields in TestArchitect and Team Foundation Server](../../TA_Help/Topics/ug_MTM_matching_custom_fields.html)  
User-defined fields in TestArchitect are automatically mapped to TFS custom fields when the names and data types match.
3.  [Upgrading build assemblies of the TestArchitect plug-in](../../TA_Help/Topics/ug_MTM_upgrading_assemblies.html)  
When the TA-TFS plug-in is installed, its information is stored in build assembly files. Whenever you upgrade the plug-in to a newer version, the assembly files also need to be upgraded, by either manual or automatic means.
4.  [Switching to a different Team Foundation Server account](../../TA_Help/Topics/ug_MTM_switching_TFS_account.html)  
When making queries to a TFS server from a TestArchitect repository, you need a TFS account to authenticate the query. If necessary, you have the option of switching from the current TFS account to a different account.
5.  [Displaying test results in a browser](../../TA_Help/Topics/ug_MTM_open_result_web.html)  
TestArchitect test results may be opened in a web browser on any machine. TestArchitect need not be installed to view the results.
6.  [Specifying a value for Team Foundation Server build number field](../../TA_Help/Topics/ug_MTM_build_number_field.html)  
Within TFS, for each test run that is recorded, a run build number must be supplied. This allows you to find the test runs quickly based on the build number.
7.  [TestArchitect-Team Foundation Server Extensibility](../../TA_Help/Topics/ug_MTM_Extensibility.html)  
The TA-TFS Extensibility feature offers you, by means of TestArchitect-supported API methods, the ability to extend and customize the environment for executing automated test cases.
8.  [TestArchitect Execution dialog box](../../TA_Help/Topics/ug_TestArchitect_execution_dialog.html)  
The TestArchitect Execution dialog box is invoked, when TestArchitect automated runs are executed via MTM.
