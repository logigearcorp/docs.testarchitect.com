You can restrict access to a project by granting permissions to selected users.

-   Ensure that your TestArchitect Client is running and connected to the repository where the project resides.
-   Ensure that you have administrative or test manager privileges.

See [Assigning permissions on specific projects to users](../../TA_Administration/Topics/adm_users_assigning_permissions.html) for instructions on how to grant user access to a project.
