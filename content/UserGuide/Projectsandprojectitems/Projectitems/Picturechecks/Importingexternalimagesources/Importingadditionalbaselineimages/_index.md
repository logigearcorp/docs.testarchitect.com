# Importing additional baseline images from external files {#task_qy4_nym_wx .task}

To import additional baseline images into an existing picture check, do the following:

1.  In the TestArchitect explorer tree, select a picture check to which you'd like to import additional baseline images:

    -   For a [regular picture check](Projects_and_tests_picture_check.md#li_Regular_picture_check), go to **Local Pictures**, residing under the **Picture Checks** tab of a specific test module.

        ![](../Images/import_regular_baseline_image.png)

    -   For a [shared picture check](Projects_and_tests_picture_check.md#li_Regular_picture_check), go to the **Picture Checks** node, or its subfolder node.

2.  Right-click the selection, and then select **Import Baseline**.

3.  In the Select dialog box, select image file\(s\) to be imported, and then click **Select**.

    **Note:**

    -   Only .PNG files are accepted.
    -   The Shift and Ctrl keys may be used with the mouse to aid in multiple selection.
