# Deleting TA bugs {#task_tr4_xm2_bm .task}

TA bugs can be removed from the system once they have been addressed.

TA bugs may be removed from the **Bugs** list view:

1.  In the TestArchitect explorer tree, open the [bug list view](Listview_bug.html) by double-clicking the **Bugs** node.

2.  Right-click the TA bug you want to delete, and then click **Delete**.

    **Restriction:** Deleting multiple TA bugs is not allowed.

    The selected TA bug is removed from the bug list view.

3.  **Important:** If you are trying to delete a TA bug that is currently marked in one or more action lines, a warning dialog box is presented:

    In this case, select one of the following:

    -   Click **OK** to close the dialog box and open the [**Related Items**](Bug_information.md#section_hc2_x4d_bm) tab of the selected TA bug.
    -   Click **Cancel** to close the dialog box and cancel the deletion.
