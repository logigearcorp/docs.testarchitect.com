# Searching item content for text {#task_mhc_n4n_bw .task}

In addition to item names, you can conduct searches of the text content of test modules, user-defined actions, data sets and interface entities.

1.  In the TestArchitect explorer tree, right-click the parent node of the item that you want to search for, and then click **Search**.

    **Fastpath:** Ctrl + H

    If you're conducting your search from a project-level node, select the item type you wish to limit the search to in the **Search in:** drop-down list.

    **Tip:**

    -   Select the **Whole word\(s\) only** check box, if you want to exclude matches that are not bound by whitespace.
    -   You can extend your search to items on all supplier project\(s\) by selecting the **Including supplier project\(s\)** check box.
3.  Click **Search**.

    If the search string is found, each item containing the string is displayed in the **Result** list box.

4.  To open a listed item, double-click it.

    **Note:** Alternatively, select an item, and then click the **View** button.

    The item is opened, with the matching text string\(s\) highlighted in yellow.
