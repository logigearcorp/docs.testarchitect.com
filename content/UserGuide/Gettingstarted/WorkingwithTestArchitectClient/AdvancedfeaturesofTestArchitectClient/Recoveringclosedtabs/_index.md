# Recovering closed tabs {#Recovering_closed_items .task}

Within a given session, TestArchitect Client keeps track of the tabs you have closed and provides you with a convenient means to reopen your recently closed tabs.

TestArchitect uses a "stacked" format for tracking the history of your tab closings. Hence, when you request the reopening of a tab multiple times, you get the last-closed tab, followed by the 2nd-to-last closed tab, etc.

The following TestArchitect project items are supported:

-   Test module
-   Data set
-   Action
-   Interface entity
-   Test suite
-   Picture check
-   Result

There are two ways to quickly reopen closed tabs:

-   In the TestArchitect test editor, right-click any open tab. The option **Reopen closed tab** appears on the context menu:

    ![](../Images/reopen_closed_tab.png)

    **Important:** TestArchitect remembers up to the last five most-recently closed tabs.

-   Alternatively, a keyboard shortcut is available. Press Ctrl + Shift + T to reopen the most recently closed item.

    **Tip:** Repeat the above steps to cycle through and open closed tabs starting from the most to the least recent.


The selected item is reopened as the active tab.
