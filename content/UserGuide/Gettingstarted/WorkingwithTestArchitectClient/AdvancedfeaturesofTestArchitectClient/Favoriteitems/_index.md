# Favorite items {#favorite_items .concept}

Keep track of TestArchitect project items which you visit frequently by storing them as favorites.

With favorites, you can:

-   Save time. Use the **Favorites** toolbar for quick retrieval of your favorite project items and add to more favorite items. Additionally, you can use the favorite list view to search through your favorites with pre-defined filters.
-   Retrieve your favorites from any test machine. No matter which host machine you may be on, you can access your favorites from a given repository after you have logged in to it, whether it is local or remote.

Test modules, data sets, user-defined actions, interface entities, test suites and repository results can be added to favorites. \(Remaining entities, such as built-in actions or local results, cannot be added to favorites.\)

**Note:** When you log in to a repository on another test machine with your account, all changes that you make to your favorite items will instantly show up on that test machine.

**Note:**

-   If you disconnect or log out from a repository which has reference to your favorites, all those favorites are removed automatically from the **Favorite** list view and from the toolbar in your TestArchitect Client session.
-   If you connect or log in to a repository, all favorites in that repository are appended automatically to your **Favorites** list view and to the current toolbar.
