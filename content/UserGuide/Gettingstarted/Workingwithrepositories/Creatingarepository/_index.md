How to create a new repository.

To create a repository, perform the following steps:

1.  Right-click the **TestArchitect** node, then select **New Repository Connection**.

2.  In the Add Repository Connection dialog box, click **New**.

    The New Repository dialog box appears.

3.  Enter a repository name into the **Repository Name** box, then click **OK**.

The new repository is added to the **Repository** list. The repository is selected automatically from the list for quick access.

**Note:** New repositories are automatically assigned a single user account named administrator. By default, no password is assigned to this account. If this is a production repository, or one with sensitive contents, the password should be changed.
