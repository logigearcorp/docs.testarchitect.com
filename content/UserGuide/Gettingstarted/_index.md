## Licensing in TestArchitect {#section_licensing_TA .section}

TestArchitect is sold on a node-locked or floating license basis. You must license your copy of TestArchitect before you can use it.

Licensing is handled through a License Server. Each time you start up TestArchitect, a License Server validates your license and grants usage rights. You need only register your license with a License Server one time. This is done by submitting a LogiGear-supplied key to a license server.

The License Server you use can reside either on your local machine, or on a remote system. The License Server you use for registration is the same server that will validate your license each time you use TestArchitect, so make certain that your License Server is installed on a machine that is always available. This is especially true in the case of multi-user licenses, where you want the active License Server to be available on your network to all valid users.

## Installing TestArchitect License Server { .section}

Run the TestArchitect License Server installer and follow the instructions to install TestArchitect License Server.

For detailed instructions, please follow the below links.

-   [Windows](http://testarchitect.logigear.com/onlinehelp/index.html#TA_InstallationGuide/DITA_source/Topics/inst_LS_Windows.html)
-   [Linux](http://testarchitect.logigear.com/onlinehelp/index.html#TA_InstallationGuide/DITA_source/Topics/inst_LS_Linux.html)

## Requesting a license key { .section}

To obtain your license key, please fill in the License Request form and submit it to us. For more information, read this [topic](http://testarchitect.logigear.com/onlinehelp/index.html#TA_Administration/Topics/LS_TA_requesting_key.html).

## Adding new license to the License Server { .section}

After you submit the request, a LogiGear representative will shortly contact you for verification, and then email you your personal key. Follow this [link](http://testarchitect.logigear.com/onlinehelp/index.html#TA_Administration/Topics/LS_TA_adding_new_license.html) to add new licenses to your License Server.
