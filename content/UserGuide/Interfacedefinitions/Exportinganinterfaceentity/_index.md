# Exporting an interface entity {#Test_result_export_import .task}

Interface entities can be exported to archive files \(.ZIP format\), which can be used as a backup or for re-importing.

Choose one of the following two methods to export interface entities:

-   **Option 1**:

    1.  In the TestArchitect explorer tree, right-click an interface entity node, and then click **Export to ZIP file**.

    2.  In the Export Interface Entity dialog box, click ![](../Images/btn.browse-ellipsis.01.png) to choose a location to save the file \(in .ZIP format\).

        **Tip:** You can accept the default location, but any place that is easy to remember will work.

    3.  Click **OK**.

        A notification message dialog box appears indicating that the export was successful.

    4.  Click **OK** to dismiss the dialog box.

-   **Option 2**:

    1.  In the TestArchitect explorer tree, double-click an interface node.

    2.  In the interface entity list view in the main panel, right-click an interface entity that you want to export, then click **Export to ZIP file**.

    3.  In the Export Interface Entity dialog box, click ![](../Images/btn.browse-ellipsis.01.png) to choose a location to save the file \(in .ZIP format\).

        **Tip:** You can accept the default location, but any place that is easy to remember will work.

        A notification message dialog box appears indicating that the export was successful.
