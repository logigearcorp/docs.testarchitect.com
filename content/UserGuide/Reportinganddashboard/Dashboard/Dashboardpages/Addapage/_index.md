# Add a page {#Dashboard_add_page .task}

Adding a new page to a Dashboard instance.

A Dashboard session can contain any number of pages, each of which can contain multiple panels. Pages are a convenient means of organizing your Dashboard content.

To add a new page to a Dashboard session:

1.  [Start the Dashboard](Dashboard_starting.html) and log in to the session with the user [permission](Dashboard_authentication_permissions.html) higher than that of the guest user.

2.  On the page selection tool bar, point to **Global Setting** and select **Add Page**.

3.  On the New Page dialog box, enter the information as requested and click **OK**.

    -   Page Name: Name of the page.
    -   Parent Page: Name of the parent page to which this page will be assigned.
    -   Number of Columns: Number of panel columns on the page.
    -   Display After: Where to display the name of the page. The name will be displayed on the Dashboard's page menu immediately to the right of the page name you select.
    -   Public: Select this check box to allow all logged-in users to view items on this page.

After adding a page to the Dashboard, you can [add predefined panels](Dashboard_add_predefined_panel.html) or create new [panels](Dashboard_panels.html) to the created page to display information about your project in the form you find most suitable.
