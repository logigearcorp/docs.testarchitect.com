# Deleting custom report profiles {#delete_profile .task}

Deleting a saved report profile removes the profile from the **Reporting** context menu and the **Report Profile** list.

1.  In the TestArchitect explorer tree, right-click the project item master node, and then select **Reporting** \> **Create reports**.

    Depending on the type of node that the report is based on, TestArchitect displays the relevant report types.

2.  On the **Create Reports** submenu, select the same report type as that of the report profile you want to delete.

3.  On the **Edit Profile** panel, select the report profile in the **Profile name** list.

4.  Click **Delete**.

    If the selected profile can be deleted, a delete confirmation message box appears.

5.  Click **Yes**.


The saved profile is deleted and all associated report-generating entries for the deleted profile are removed from the **Reporting** submenu.
