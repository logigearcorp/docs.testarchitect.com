# Finding bugs with TestArchitect {#concept.debugging_with_ta .concept}

In a perfect world, your test runs encounter no errors or warnings and your flawless application produces no failures when tested. In a semi-perfect world, the errors and warnings that do occur indicate a problem with your test, and failures highlight a problem with the application.

But in the real world, errors, warnings and failures can mean anything: problems with the test or problems with the tested application. What's important is that you or your team be able to diagnose the causes of your problems as quickly and accurately as possible, in order to address them.

Toward that end,

TestArchitect offers two tools to aid you in the quick identification of errors, warnings, and failures: the debugger, and screenshot recording.

1.  [Debugging with TestArchitect](../../TA_Help/Topics/Debugging.html)  
The TestArchitect debugger allows you to run an application under test interactively while observing the action lines and results at each stage of execution, as well as the state of the AUT. Variables, arguments, and settings at each stage may also be observed, and modified.
2.  [Screenshot recording](../../TA_Help/Topics/ug_Screenshot_recording.html)  
TestArchitect allows snapshots to be automatically taken of the AUT's display at various critical points during test execution. By letting you observe the display state of the AUT at each stage of the test, you can have a better grasp of where and how a test, or application, is going wrong.
