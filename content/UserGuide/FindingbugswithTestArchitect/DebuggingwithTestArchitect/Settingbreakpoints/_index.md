# Setting breakpoints {#Debugging_setting_breakpoint .task}

A breakpoint is a location in your action lines that has been designated as a point at which execution is to be paused. With execution thus halted, you can view information about the running application's state at the given point.

1.  In the TestArchitect explorer tree, double-click a test module or an action node to open it.

2.  With a test module or action in your test editor, select an action line at which you would like to set a breakpoint.

3.  Do one of the following:

    -   Double-click the row header.
    -   Right-click the selected action line, then select **Debug** \> **Toggle Breakpoint**.

A red dot appears next to the action line you have designated, indicating a breakpoint at that location.

After defining breakpoints, you can run your test procedure through the debugger. See [Starting the debugger](Debugging_starting_debugger.html) for further information.
