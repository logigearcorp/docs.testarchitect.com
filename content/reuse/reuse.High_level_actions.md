# User-defined actions

User-defined actions are actions that you create in TestArchitect's Action Based Testing language.User-defined actions may be comprised of any type of action: [built-in](/TA_Automation/Topics/bia_Built_in_actions.html), [user-scripted](/TA_Glossary/Topics/glossaryScriptedAction.html), or other user-defined actions, or any combination of the above.

While TestArchitect offers a library of hundreds of built-in actions for you to build your tests from, you will often find it necessary to create your own actions. Two types of such custom actions are possible: user-defined actions and user-scripted actions. Of the two, user-defined actions have the benefit of being the easiest to create, requiring no special skill level beyond a basic understanding of TestArchitect test authorship. They are also more convenient and faster to write and incorporate into your tests.

In general, you create user-defined actions for two reasons:

1.  **Modularity**:

    It is often the case that a given sequence of action lines performs what can be considered a single, well-defined function. Often this function must be repeated throughout a test, or across tests in a project. In such instances, it makes sense to embody, or [encapsulate](/TA_Glossary/Topics/glossaryActionEncapsulation.html), the sequence into a user-defined action. In place of each instance of the action line sequence, only a single action line, one that invokes the new user-defined action, is required.

    Sometimes instances of action line sequences differ only by the data values they operate on. In such cases, the user-defined actions that replace them can handle the variability of data values through the use of arguments.

    Encapsulating action line sequences into user-defined actions enhances your test in two ways:

    -   **Readability**: It is easier to comprehend a test that presents steps at a higher, more humanly-intuitive level. It is also less tiring when one doesn't have to frequently encounter identical sets of steps.
    -   **Maintainability**: Incorporating a frequently used functionality into an action that can be called from multiple places means that, when a change to that functionality is warranted, the modification need only be performed in a single place, rather than multiple places. This not only reduces maintenance time, but lessens the chance of introducing errors.
2.  **Isolation of implementation details**: Some functionalities of an application under test may easily change from one version to the next. It is in your best interest to confine implementation-dependent actions to your custom actions. Again, maintenance is minimized across application versions, and your test modules are left to focus solely on business logic.

A user-defined action is comparable to a function, complete with arguments that can be passed to it to control the actionâ€™s behavior, as well as arguments that allow the function to return values to the calling entity. By calling on a user-defined action, a test module \(or other user-defined action\) executes a number of steps relating to a particular function or activity while isolating itself from all of the individual actions involved. Letting user-defined actions do low-level work enhances the readability of test modules, especially when the actions are well-named and their purpose is clear.

2.  [Smart creation of new actions](/TA_Help/Topics/High_level_actions_smart_creating.html)  
Rapidly create a new user-defined action from a contiguous set of actions in the test editor.
3.  [Entering a new action line](/TA_Help/Topics/High_level_actions_using.html)  
After creating a user-defined action, the test editor is made aware of it.
4.  [Argument types](/reuse/reuse.Creating_and_using_actions_Arg_type.html)  
An action argument can have one of several possible data types.
5.  [Exporting actions](/TA_Help/Topics/High_level_actions_exporting.html)  
A user-defined action can be exported to an archive file \(.ZIP format\), which can be used as a backup or for reimporting.
6.  [Importing actions](/TA_Help/Topics/High_level_actions_importing.html)  
You can easily import a user-defined action stored in an archive file \(.ZIP format\).
