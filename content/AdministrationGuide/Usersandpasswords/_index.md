# Users and passwords {#concept_adm_users_and_passwords .concept}

TestArchitect user administration responsibilities include maintaining user accounts and assigning projects to each account. If warranted by security needs, sensitive passwords used for access to an AUT may also be encrypted.

TestArchitect offers many functional user groups, such as guests, testers, test managers, and administrators, allowing you to manage test resources more easily. For issues of security and data protection, you may assign each user to one or more projects with specific privileges tailored to provide access to certain project items.

For additional protection, TestArchitect can save and encrypt passwords which are used for access to an application under test. Encrypted passwords can then be used within tests when submitted with the built-in [enter](../../TA_Automation/Topics/bia_enter.html) action.

1.  [User administration](../../TA_Administration/Topics/User_administration.html)

2.  [Managing AUT passwords](../../TA_Administration/Topics/Manage_password.html)  
TestArchitect can save and encrypt passwords which are used for access to an application under test. Encrypted passwords can then be used within tests in combination with the enter built-in action.
