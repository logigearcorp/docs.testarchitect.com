# Closing the Repository Server Control Panel {#repo_server_management_closing .concept}

Closing the Repository Server Control Panel does not change the running status of the repository service nor the TA Repository Server service.

The **Close** command, available as a button and also on the **File** menu, merely closes the Repository Server Control Panel. It affects neither the repository service nor the Repository Server Service.

The control panel may be reopened by double-clicking the Repository Server's icon ![](../Images/admin_RS_icn_RSrunning.png) in the Windows notification area.
