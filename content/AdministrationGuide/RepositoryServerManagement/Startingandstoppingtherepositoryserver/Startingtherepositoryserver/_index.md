# Starting the repository server {#task_xj4_fmt_5q .task}

This section describes procedures for starting the repository server.

1.  [Launch](Repo_server_management_launching.html) the Repository Server Control Panel.

    A successful launching of the Repository Server Control Panel ensures that the TA Repository Server service is running.

2.  If the repository server is not currently running, the message The repository service is stopped is displayed in the lower left of the control panel, and the **Start Repository Service** button ![](../Images/btn.RS_start_repo.png) is enabled. Click this button.

    An activity indicator appears in the lower left, along with the message, Starting serverâ€¦.

Once the server has successfully started, the control panel closes and the **Repository Server** icon ![](../Images/admin_RS_icn_RSrunning.png) appears in your notification area \(Windows/Linux\), or in the **Status** menu \(macOS\) with a green arrow to indicate that the server is running.
