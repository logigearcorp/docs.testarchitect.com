# Tool Profiles {#Test_tool_profile .concept}

Using **Tool Profiles**, you can configure TestArchitect to support integration with external third-party tools. In addition, its support for LDAP \(Lightweight Directory Access Protocol\) allows your TestArchitect login credentials to be established through your system account, avoiding the need for a separate sign on. Finally, **Tool Profiles** includes several predefined harnesses, which are scripts or programs that interpret and execute the action lines of a test sequence.

**Remember:** You must be logged in to TestArchitect Client as a member of the [administrator](User_administration.html) group to configure external tools, or create or edit test tool profiles. Administrator changes are made available to all other clients logging in to the same repository.
