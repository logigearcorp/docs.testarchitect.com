In addition to its contents, every project item in TestArchitect has various metadata associated with it. Such fields as **Name**, **Assigned user**, **Description** and **Creation date** can be viewed by opening a given item and clicking on its **Information** tab. In addition to these predefined fields, TestArchitect allows you to create your own custom fields for project items, to use in accordance with your requirements.

A user-defined field enables you to store additional information for project items. Furthermore, user-defined fields can be useful in integrating your project with external tools, such as [HP Quality Center](../../TA_Help/Topics/Integration_QC_creating_mapping_custom_field.html). You can often enhance the utility of an external tool with custom fields that allow more data to be exchanged between the tool and your project items.

1.  [Creating a user-defined field](../../TA_Administration/Topics/User_defined_fields_create.html)  
There may be times when you'll want to augment the set of fields that TestArchitect provides for a given project item type. You can do that by creating new fields and adding them to the item type definition.
2.  [Editing a user-defined field](../../TA_Administration/Topics/User_defined_fields_edit.html)  
You can edit the **Name**, **Short Name**, or **Default Value** properties of all user-defined fields.
3.  [Deleting a user-defined field](../../TA_Administration/Topics/User_defined_fields_delete.html)  
If you no longer need a user-defined field, you can delete it.
