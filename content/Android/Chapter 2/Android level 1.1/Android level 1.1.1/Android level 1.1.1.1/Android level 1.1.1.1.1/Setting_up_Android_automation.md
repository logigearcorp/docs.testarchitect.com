**Important:** Android automation is only supported on Windows.

1.  [About TestArchitect Agent in Android](../../Android/Topics/Android_TA_agent.md)  
TestArchitect Agent is an essential component in allowing TestArchitect to communicate with Android devices during automated testing.
2.  [Installing a testable Android application](../../Android/Topics/Installing_applications.md)  
Installing an application on a target device for testing purposes is a two-step process which involves re-signing and installing the application.
3.  [Launching an Android AUT](../../Android/Topics/Launching_an_AUT.md)  
Any application to be tested on a target device must be launched in a manner that allows TestArchitect to properly interface with it.
