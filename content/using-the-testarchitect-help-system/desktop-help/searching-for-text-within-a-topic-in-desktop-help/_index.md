Describes how to search for specific text within a topic.

To search for a text string within a topic, carry out the following steps:

1.  Open the desired topic.

    You can do this by navigating the [table of contents](/TA_UsingHelpSystem/Topics/hs_CHM_search.html), by searching for the topic in the [**Index**](/TA_UsingHelpSystem/Topics/hs_CHM_search.html) tab, or by using the [full-text search](/TA_UsingHelpSystem/Topics/hs_CHM_full_text_search.html).

2.  Click somewhere within the topic and press Ctrl- F.

3.  In the Find dialog box, specify the text and the search options, then press Enter or click **Next**.


If the search is successful, the Help viewer highlights the first occurrence of the text string. To continue searching for further occurrences, continue pressing Enter or clicking **Next**. Note that, if you have selected the **Highlight all matches** check box in the Find dialog box, all occurrences of the search string in the topic are highlighted concurrently.
