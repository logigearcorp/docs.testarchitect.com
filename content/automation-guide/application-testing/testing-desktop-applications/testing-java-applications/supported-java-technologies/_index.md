Java Runtime Environment \(JRE\) versions and Java controls supported by TestArchitect.

TestArchitect supports testing Java applications that use the following technologies:

-   JRE 8, 7, 6 \(both 32-bit and 64-bit versions\).
-   Only Java applets running on an applet viewer can be tested. Testing Java applets embedded into a web page is not supported.
-   Swing Java controls. \(See [Support for Java Applications' Controls](/TA_Automation/Topics/aut_app_testing_Java_apps_supported_controls.html).\)
-   JSP or Java Servlet web applications. \(See [Testing web applications](/TA_Automation/Topics/Web_automation.html#section_ipl_bzc_m4) for details on how to test web applications with TestArchitect.\)
