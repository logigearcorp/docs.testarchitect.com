Information specific to Java application testing.

TestArchitect supports testing of 32-bit and 64-bit Java applications created with the Swing GUI widget toolkit. In addition to Java applications, you can also test Java applets with TestArchitect. You can record and play back various interactions with Java applications. To ensure that the tested application functions properly, you can insert validity checks to confirm that recorded values are output correctly.

**Important:** Only Java applets running on an applet viewer can be tested. Testing Java applets embedded into a web page is not supported.
