For power-saving purposes, computers are often configured to go into a non-active state \(such as sleep\) after a certain period of inactivity. By default, the processes associated with automated testing are typically not treated as “activities”, in this sense. Hence, for long execution runs, especially unattended ones, it is important that any machines serving as test controllers be configured not to lapse into any non-active mode during the test period. \(Typically, your computer's power policy is configured through its Control Panel, System Preferences, or command line, depending on the platform. For details, see your system administrator or information specific to the machine's operating system.\)
