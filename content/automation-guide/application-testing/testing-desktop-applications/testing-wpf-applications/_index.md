Information specific to Windows Presentation Foundation \(WPF\) application testing.

TestArchitect supports testing of 32-bit and 64-bit WPF applications. You can record and play back various interactions with WPF applications. To ensure that the tested application functions properly, you can insert validity checks to confirm that recorded values are output correctly.

**Note:** Since WPF applications are .NET applications, concepts and features of testing .NET applications also apply to WPF applications. Refer to [Testing .NET applications](/TA_Automation/Topics/aut_app_testing_NET_apps.html) for details.
