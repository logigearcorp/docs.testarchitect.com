Information specific to Win32 application testing.

A Win32 application is a native desktop application that has a window-based user interface and can run on Windows versions. Win32, despite its name, can refer to either a 32- or 64-bit application. TestArchitect supports testing of both 32-bit and 64-bit Win32 applications. You can record and play back various interactions with Win32 applications. To ensure that the tested application functions properly, you can insert validity checks to confirm that recorded values are output correctly.
