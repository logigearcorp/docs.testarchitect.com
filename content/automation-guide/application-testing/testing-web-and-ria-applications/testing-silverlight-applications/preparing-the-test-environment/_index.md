In order to test a Silverlight application, you need to properly configure your test environment. This may include preparing a web browser's settings, installing a Certificate Authority, and possibly other actions.

{{<warning>}} Microsoft ceased development of Silverlight. However, Silverlight continues working in TestArchitect.

For a complete checklist, see the following topics:

1.  [Preparing a web browser for testing Silverlight applications](/automation-guide/application-testing/testing-web-and-ria-applications/testing-silverlight-applications/preparing-the-test-environment/preparing-a-web-browser)  
To allow TestArchitect to work properly with a Silverlight application embedded into a web page, you may need to prepare your web browser.
2.  [Installing a Certificate Authority](/automation-guide/application-testing/testing-web-and-ria-applications/testing-silverlight-applications/preparing-the-test-environment/installing-a-certificate-authority)  
In order to test Silverlight applications running over the HTTPS protocol, installing a TestArchitect Certificate Authority \(CA\) on your test machine is required.
3.  [Configuring a test machine for Silverlight](/automation-guide/application-testing/testing-web-and-ria-applications/testing-silverlight-applications/preparing-the-test-environment/configuring-a-test-machine-for-silverlight)  
Preparing your test machine to ensure the testability of your Silverlight application.
