If you no longer need to test Silverlight applications running over the HTTPS protocol, you may opt to uninstall the TestArchitect Certificate Authority \(CA\) which was previously installed.

{{<warning>}} Microsoft ceased development of Silverlight. However, Silverlight continues working in TestArchitect.

To uninstall a CA, do the following:

1.  Open Certificate Manager by clicking the **Start** button, typing certmgr.msc into the **Search** box, and then pressing ENTER. â€Œ

2.  In the certmgr dialog box, expand **Certificates - Current User** \> **Trusted Root Certification Authorities** \> **Certificates**.

4.  On the **Action** menu, click the **Delete** ![](/images/TA_Automation/Images/removing_CA_button.png) button.

5.  Click **Yes** if you are sure that you want to permanently delete the certificates.
