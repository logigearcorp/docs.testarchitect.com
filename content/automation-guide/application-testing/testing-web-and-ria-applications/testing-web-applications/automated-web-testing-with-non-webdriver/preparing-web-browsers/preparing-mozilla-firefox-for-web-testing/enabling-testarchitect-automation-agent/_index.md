On Linux machines only, enabling the TestArchitect Automation Agent in Mozilla Firefox is required for testing web-based applications with TestArchitect in that browser.

TestArchitect Automation Agent is automatically added as an add-on/extension to any installed browsers during TestArchitect installation. If you find that the TestArchitect Automation Agent is not present in your browser \(as would be the case if you installed the browser after installing TestArchitect\), you can use the [Automation Agent Manager](/reuse/../TA_Help/Topics/Test_exec_automation_agent_manager.html) to add the agent to your browser.

To enable the TestArchitect Automation Agent in Mozilla Firefox:

1.  Start Mozilla Firefox, then access the **Add-ons Manager**:

    -   If using Firefox version 29 or later, click the Menu ![](/images/TA_Automation/Images/btn.Firefox_Australis.menu.png) button, then select **Add-ons**.
    -   If using a version of Firefox prior to v.29, click the **Firefox** menu, and then click **Add-ons**.
2.  In the **Add-ons Manager** tab, select the Extension panel.

3.  Look for the add-on named TestArchitect Automation Agent and check that its status is not Disabled. If the status is Disabled, click the **Enable** button to enable the add-on.

4.  Restart the browser to ensure that the change takes effect.


The TestArchitect Automation Agent is now enabled in Mozilla Firefox.
