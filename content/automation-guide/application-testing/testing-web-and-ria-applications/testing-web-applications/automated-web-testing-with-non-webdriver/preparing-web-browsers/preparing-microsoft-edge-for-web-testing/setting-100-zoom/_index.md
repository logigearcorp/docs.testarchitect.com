TestArchitect requires that the browser zoom be set to 100% to correctly identify HTML controls and their positions on web pages.

Microsoft Edge uses 100% zoom by default. If you change the zoom manually, you can restore it by doing one of the following:

-   Press Ctrl + 0.

-   Click the **More Actions** button in the upper right corner and use the **+** or **-** button of the **Zoom** menu item to set the value to 100%.
