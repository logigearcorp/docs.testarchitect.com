TestArchitect requires that the browser zoom be set to 100% to correctly identify HTML controls and their positions on web pages.

Google Chrome uses 100% zoom by default. If you changed the zoom manually, you can restore it by doing one of the following

-   Press Ctrl + 0.

-   Click Chrome's **Customize and control Google Chrome** ![](/images/TA_Automation/Images/Chrome_btn.png) button. From the drop-down menu, use the **+** or **-** button of the **Zoom** menu item to set the value to 100%.
