How to create a new platform to support cross-browser testing.

To execute your tests across multiple browsers types you must create a new platform, for example **Browser**.

1.  Right-click the **Systems & Platforms** node, and then select **New System or Platform**.

2.  In the New System dialog box, enter the details for the new platform:

    -   Name: Name of the new platform. For example: Browser.
    -   Description: \(optional\) Short description of the platform.
3.  Click **Create.**


The **Browser** platform is added as a node beneath the **Systems & Platforms** node.
