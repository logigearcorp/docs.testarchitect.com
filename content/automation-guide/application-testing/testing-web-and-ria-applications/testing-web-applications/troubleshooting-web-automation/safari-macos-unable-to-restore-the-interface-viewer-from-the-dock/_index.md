## Problem

When you use the [Highlight/Auto-Highlight](/TA_Help/Topics/Interface_def_Viewer_highlight.html#li_iyk_rtw_jt) feature in the Interface Viewer to highlight web controls running on Safari macOS, the Viewer automatically minimizes itself to an icon on the Dock. However, clicking on the icon in the Dock fails to restore the minimized Viewer.

## Solution

Deactivate the Minimized windows into application icon option by doing the following:

1.  Open the **Dock**'s preferences settings by selecting **Apple menu** \> **System Preferences**, and then clicking **Dock**.
2.  Clear the **Minimized windows into application icon** check box.
3.  Restart the Interface Viewer.
