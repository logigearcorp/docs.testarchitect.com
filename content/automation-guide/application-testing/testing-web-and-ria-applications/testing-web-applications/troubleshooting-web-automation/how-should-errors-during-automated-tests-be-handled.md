**A**: TestArchitect provides the following built-in actions for handling errors or unexpected behaviors during automated tests:

-   [on error](/automation-guide/action-based-testing-language/built-in-actions/test-support-actions/error-handling/on-error): Specifies the programmatic control flow that is to take place if and when an error occurs.
-   [on error action](/automation-guide/action-based-testing-language/built-in-actions/test-support-actions/error-handling/on-error-action): Specifies an action \(an error handler\) that is to be executed in the event an error occurs.
-   [on failure action](/automation-guide/action-based-testing-language/built-in-actions/test-support-actions/error-handling/on-failure-action): Specifies the action that is to be executed in the event of a check failure.
