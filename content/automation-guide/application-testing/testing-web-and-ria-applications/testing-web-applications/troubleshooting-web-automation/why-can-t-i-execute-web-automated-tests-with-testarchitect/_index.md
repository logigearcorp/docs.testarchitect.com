**A**: One possible reason is that you have not enabled or installed the TestArchitect Automation Agent in your web browser. This step is essential to executing web automated tests. To solve this issue, follow the steps below:

-   **Case 1**: If you installed your browser prior to installing TestArchitect, the TestArchitect Automation Agent was automatically installed in your browser. However, you still need to configure settings to enable the TestArchitect Automation Agent.

    1.  For Google Chrome \(see [TestArchitect Automation Agent in Google Chrome](/TA_Help/Topics/ug_preparing_Chrome.html)\).

    2.  For Internet Explorer \(see [TestArchitect Automation Agent in Internet Explorer](/TA_Help/Topics/ug_preparing_Internet_Explorer.html)\).

    3.  For Mozilla Firefox \(see [TestArchitect Automation Agent in Mozilla Firefox](/TA_Help/Topics/ug_preparing_Firefox.html)\).

-   **Case 2**: If you installed your browser *after* installing TestArchitect Client, you must manually install and enable the [TestArchitect Automation Agent](/TA_Help/Topics/Test_exec_automation_agent_manager.html) for each browser within which you want to perform web-based automated testing.
