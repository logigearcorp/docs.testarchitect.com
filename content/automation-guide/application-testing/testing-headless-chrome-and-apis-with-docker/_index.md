Docker is a platform designed to assist developers, testers, sysadmins, etc. with development, testing, deployment and running of applications through containerization

Docker containers package applications and all their dependencies into a distributable image that is capable of running across different environments. In other words, a container acts like an isolated environment where an application can run without affecting the rest of the system or being affected by the rest of the system. \([Learn more](https://docs.docker.com/engine/)\)

Compared to virtual machines, containers are more lightweight and consume less resource because virtual machines need a full OS while containers run on the shared OS.

With the new [TestArchitect-Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/logigear/testarchitect/), you can run TestArchitect tests inside Docker containers for faster test development and scalability. For a detailed guide, go to [Dockerize TestArchitect tests](https://www.logigear.com/magazine/continuous-delivery-and-devops/dockerize-with-testarchitect/).
