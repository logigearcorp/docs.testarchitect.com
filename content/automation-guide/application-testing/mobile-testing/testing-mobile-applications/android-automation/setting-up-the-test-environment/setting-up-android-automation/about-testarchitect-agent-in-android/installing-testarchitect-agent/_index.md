How to install TestArchitect Agent onto Android devices.

**Important:** Android automation is only supported on Windows.

At the present time, installation to a physical device requires a USB cable connection to the host PC. \(Hence, if working with a physical device that has not yet been set up for communication with the host PC, refer to the instructions given in [Setting up a physical Android device via USB cable](/Android/Topics/Setting_up_physical_device_usb.html).\)

Do the following to install the TestArchitect Agent onto your Android device:

1.  With your physical Android device connected via USB cable, or emulator up and running, launch the [Android Instrumentation Applications](/Android/Topics/Android_Instrumentation_tool.html) dialog box.

    You should see a grey icon representing your device in the Devices panel on the Android Instrumentation Applications dialog box. A grey icon indicates that the device is visible to TestArchitect, but that the TestArchitect Agent is not yet installed.

2.  Right-click the icon and select **Install TestArchitect Automation Agent**.

    **Fastpath:** Alternatively, click the button **Install TestArchitect Automation Agent on selected device** ![](/images/Android/Images/android_installing_TA_agent_btn.png), on the toolbar.

    Upon successful installation, the device icon, formerly grey, becomes green. This indicates that the functioning TestArchitect Agent application now resides on your device.

3.  You may remove the USB cable connection after you have installed the TestArchitect Agent onto the physical device that you intend to test.


In addition to the presence of a green icon in the Android Instrumentation Applications dialog box, you may verify that the TestArchitect Agent is running on a device by checking Androidâ€™s **Manage Applications** utility:

-   On a device with Android 4.0 or higher, the **Manage Applications** utility is available under **Settings** \> **Applications manager**.
-   On a device with Android version lower than 4.0, the **Manage Applications** utility is available under **Settings** \> **Applications** \> **Manage applications**.
