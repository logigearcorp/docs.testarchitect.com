If you no longer have a need to have TestArchitect Agent present in a given device, you can uninstall it.

To uninstall the TestArchitect Agent:

1.  With your physical Android device connected via USB cable, or emulator up and running, launch the [Android Instrumentation Tool](Android_Instrumentation_tool.html)dialog box.

    You should see a green icon representing your device in the Devices panel in the Android Instrumentation Applications dialog box.

2.  Right-click the icon and select **Uninstall TestArchitect Automation Agent**.

    **Fastpath:** Alternatively, click the button **Uninstall TestArchitect Automation Agent on selected device** ![](/images//Images/android_uninstalling_TA_agent_btn.png), on the toolbar.

    Upon successful uninstallation, the device icon, formerly green, becomes grey. This indicates that the TestArchitect Agent application is now removed from your device.
