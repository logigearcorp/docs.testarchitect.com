Installing an application on a target device for testing purposes is a two-step process which involves re-signing and installing the application.

{{<note>}}

-   Android automation is only supported on Windows, or Linux hosts.
-   You must have an administrative right to re-sign \(only for the first re-signing\) and install applications under test on the Android mobile device.

1.  [Re-signing the Android application](/Android/Topics/Installing_applications_resigning.html)  
Resigning applications is the first step in the process of installing them for testing purposes.
2.  [Installing the re-signed Android application onto a target device](/Android/Topics/Installing_applications_to_a_target_device.html)  
After successfully re-signing the application, you can install it to a device.
