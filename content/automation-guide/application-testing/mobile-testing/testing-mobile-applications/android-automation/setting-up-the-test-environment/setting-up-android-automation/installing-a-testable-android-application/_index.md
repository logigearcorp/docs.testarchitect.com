Installing an application on a target device for testing purposes is a two-step process which involves re-signing and installing the application.

{{<note>}}

-   Android automation is only supported on Windows, or Linux hosts.
-   You must have an administrative right to re-sign \(only for the first re-signing\) and install applications under test on the Android mobile device.

Resigning applications is the first step in the process of installing them for testing purposes.

After successfully re-signing the application, you can install it to a device.
