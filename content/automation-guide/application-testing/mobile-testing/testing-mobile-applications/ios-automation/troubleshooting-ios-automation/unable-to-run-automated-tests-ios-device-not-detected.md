## Problem

During an automated test run, the following error message appears in the Automation Problem dialog box or test result:

Could not detect your iOS device. Either it is currently locked or the re-signed app is inactive.

## Solution

Follow the steps below and re-run the automated test after each step:

-   Unlock your iOS device.
-   Verify that the re-signed application is already active: that is, launched on your device. \(See [Launching an AUT](/automation-guide/application-testing/mobile-testing/testing-mobile-applications/ios-automation/launching-an-aut) for details.\)
