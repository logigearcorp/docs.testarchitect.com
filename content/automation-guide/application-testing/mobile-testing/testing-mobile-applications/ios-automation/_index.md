An introduction to the basics of TestArchitect automation on iOS devices, and the steps involved in setting up the test environment.

{{<important>}} iOS automation is only supported on Windows or macOS hosts.

TestArchitect supports the following:

|||
|------|------|
|Desktop operating systems|Mojave \(10.14\), High Sierra \(10.13\), Sierra \(10.12\), El Capitan \(10.11\), Yosemite \(10.10\).|
|Mobile operating systems|-   iOS 7.x.<br>-   iOS 8.4, iOS 8.1.x, iOS 8.0.x,<br>-   iOS 9.3.x, iOS 9.2.x, iOS 9.1, iOS 9.0<br>-   iOS 10.3.x<br><br>|<br>
|Devices|All types of iPhone and iPad.|

{{<note>}}

-   If an app is designed specifically for an iPhone, that app can only be tested on an iPhone device. The same is true for iPad.

Before beginning automated testing on an iOS device, make sure the device is set up for development use and that the device's settings are configured correctly. \(See [iOS testing prerequisites](/automation-guide/application-testing/mobile-testing/testing-mobile-applications/ios-automation/ios-testing-prerequisites), [Enabling development mode on iOS device](/automation-guide/application-testing/mobile-testing/testing-mobile-applications/ios-automation/setting-up-the-ios-test-environment/setting-up-ios-automation/enabling-development-mode-on-ios-device), and [Configuring an iOS device](/automation-guide/application-testing/mobile-testing/testing-mobile-applications/ios-automation/setting-up-the-ios-test-environment/configuring-an-ios-device) for details on how to ensure your device is ready to serve as a testing platform\).
