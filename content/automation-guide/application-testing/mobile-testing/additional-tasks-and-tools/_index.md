Additional tasks you may need to perform when creating and running automated tests for mobile applications, and tools designed to assist you.

1.  [Device Live Screen](/automation-guide/application-testing/mobile-testing/additional-tasks-and-tools/device-live-screen/)  
Device Live Screen is a tool built into the TestArchitect Client environment to assist you in creating interface definitions for your tests.
2.  [Capturing screenshots of a mobile device](/automation-guide/application-testing/mobile-testing/additional-tasks-and-tools/capturing-screenshots-of-a-mobile-device)  
Device Live Screen is a useful tool for capturing images off of Android and iOS devices, allowing you to take full advantage of TestArchitect's picture handling functionality in automated tests.
3.  [Running automated tests on multiple mobile devices](/automation-guide/application-testing/mobile-testing/additional-tasks-and-tools/running-automated-tests-on-multiple-mobile-devices)  
It is important to test a mobile application on different devices \(smartphones, tablets, phablets, etc.\) to ensure that it behaves in a consistent and correct manner on all of them. TestArchitect allows an automated test to run on multiple mobile devices concurrently.
4.  [Executing cross-platform mobile automated tests](/automation-guide/application-testing/mobile-testing/additional-tasks-and-tools/executing-cross-platform-mobile-automated-tests/)
