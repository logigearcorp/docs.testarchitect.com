Device Live Screen is a tool built into the TestArchitect Client environment to assist you in creating interface definitions for your tests. Device Live Screen provides a window on your desktop which mirrors, in real time, the screen of the mobile device under test. Use this window in combination with the point-to-identify mode to quickly identify those controls in the application which are needed for tests.

Topics of this section provide detailed information about the Device Live Screen window.
