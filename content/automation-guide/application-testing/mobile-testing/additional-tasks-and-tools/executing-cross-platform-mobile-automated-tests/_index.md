TestArchitect provides a [Variations](/user-guide/variations/) feature that makes creating cross-platform mobile tests easier. Additionally, the [Car Rental Mobile](/user-guide/getting-started/sample-repository/car-rental-mobile/) sample project is provided with installation of TestArchitect to give you a better understanding of how to use [Variations](/user-guide/variations/) in creating cross-platform mobile tests.

{{<note>}} The supported mobile platforms are [Android](/automation-guide/application-testing/mobile-testing/testing-mobile-applications/android-automation/) and [iOS](/automation-guide/application-testing/mobile-testing/testing-mobile-applications/ios-automation/).
