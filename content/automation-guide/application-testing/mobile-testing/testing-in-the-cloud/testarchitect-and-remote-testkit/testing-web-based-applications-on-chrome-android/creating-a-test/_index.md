Explains general workflow to test mobile web applications on Android cloud devices in the Remote TestKit cloud service.

In TestArchitect, desired capabilities are defined through the [assign cloud device](/automation-guide/action-based-testing-language/built-in-actions/system-actions/device/assign-cloud-device) built-in action \([learn more](/automation-guide/application-testing/mobile-testing/testing-in-the-cloud/testarchitect-and-remote-testkit/testing-web-based-applications-on-chrome-android/creating-a-test/a-single-cloud-device)\), or in a JSON file \([learn more](/automation-guide/application-testing/mobile-testing/testing-in-the-cloud/testarchitect-and-remote-testkit/testing-web-based-applications-on-chrome-android/creating-a-test/multiple-cloud-devices)\).

1.  [Selecting a single cloud device during execution](/automation-guide/application-testing/mobile-testing/testing-in-the-cloud/testarchitect-and-remote-testkit/testing-web-based-applications-on-chrome-android/creating-a-test/a-single-cloud-device)  
From within your action lines, you can control which cloud device your test is to execute on. The built-in assign cloud device action is used to specify a target cloud device upon which the subsequent action lines are to be run.
2.  [Selecting multiple cloud devices at launch time](/automation-guide/application-testing/mobile-testing/testing-in-the-cloud/testarchitect-and-remote-testkit/testing-web-based-applications-on-chrome-android/creating-a-test/multiple-cloud-devices)  
It is important to test mobile web applications on different cloud devices \(smartphones, tablets, phablets, etc.\) to ensure that it behaves in a consistent and correct manner on all of them. TestArchitect allows an automated test to run on multiple cloud mobile devices concurrently.
