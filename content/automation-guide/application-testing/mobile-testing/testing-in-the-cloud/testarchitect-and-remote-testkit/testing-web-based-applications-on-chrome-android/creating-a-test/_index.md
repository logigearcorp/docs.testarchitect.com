Explains general workflow to test mobile web applications on Android cloud devices in the Remote TestKit cloud service.

In TestArchitect, desired capabilities are defined through the [assign cloud device](/TA_Automation/Topics/bia_assign_cloud_device.html) built-in action \([learn more](/TA_Automation/Topics/aut_app_cloud_testing_RTK_Android_Chrome_automation.html)\), or in a JSON file \([learn more](/TA_Automation/Topics/aut_app_cloud_testing_Appium_RTK_multiple_Android_cloud_devices.html)\).

1.  [Selecting a single cloud device during execution](/TA_Automation/Topics/aut_app_cloud_testing_RTK_Android_Chrome_automation.html)  
From within your action lines, you can control which cloud device your test is to execute on. The built-in assign cloud device action is used to specify a target cloud device upon which the subsequent action lines are to be run.
2.  [Selecting multiple cloud devices at launch time](/TA_Automation/Topics/aut_app_cloud_testing_Appium_RTK_multiple_Android_cloud_devices.html)  
It is important to test mobile web applications on different cloud devices \(smartphones, tablets, phablets, etc.\) to ensure that it behaves in a consistent and correct manner on all of them. TestArchitect allows an automated test to run on multiple cloud mobile devices concurrently.
