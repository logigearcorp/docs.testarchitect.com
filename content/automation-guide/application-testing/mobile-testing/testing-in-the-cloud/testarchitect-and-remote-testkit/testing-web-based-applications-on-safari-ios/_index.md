Using TestArchitect, you can create and run automated tests for mobile web applications \(Safari\) on iOS cloud devices rented in the Remote TestKit service.

The makers of Remote TestKit offer their service as either a web application, accessible immediately from a web browser, or by means of a client software application. For automating with TestArchitect, however, it is necessary that you [download](https://appkitbox.com/en/testkit/download) and [install](https://appkitbox.com/en/testkit/support/signin/signin13) the Remote TestKit Client application.
