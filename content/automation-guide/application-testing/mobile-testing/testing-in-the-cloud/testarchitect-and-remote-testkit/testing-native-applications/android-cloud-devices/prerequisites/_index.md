Guides to setting up WebView, and native applications on cloud Android devices, so that they may be automated under TestArchitect.

1.  [Enabling the Android adb command](/automation-guide/application-testing/mobile-testing/testing-in-the-cloud/testarchitect-and-remote-testkit/testing-native-applications/android-cloud-devices/prerequisites/enabling-the-android-adb-command)  
Remote TestKit provides standard adb \(Android Debug Bridge\) functionality to enable the use of adb commands to access remote devices. This is the equivalent of having a smartphone device connected directly to your computer via USB.
2.  [Installing TestArchitect Agent](/automation-guide/application-testing/mobile-testing/testing-in-the-cloud/testarchitect-and-remote-testkit/testing-native-applications/android-cloud-devices/prerequisites/installing-testarchitect-agent)  
TestArchitect Agent is an essential component in allowing TestArchitect to communicate with Chrome, WebView, or native applications running on a cloud Android device during automated testing.
3.  [Installing a testable AUT on an Android cloud device](/automation-guide/application-testing/mobile-testing/testing-in-the-cloud/testarchitect-and-remote-testkit/testing-native-applications/android-cloud-devices/prerequisites/installing-a-testable-aut-on-an-android-cloud-device/)  
Installing an AUT on a target cloud device for testing purposes is a two-step process which involves re-signing and installing the application.
