## Syntax

`long Minimize()`

## Description  

Minimize the window.

## Return Value  

Return 0 if the call is successful \(as reported back by the operating system\); otherwise, -1.

## Notes

-   The effect of execution is that the window represented by the AbtEntity object is reduced to an icon on the task bar. The next window in Windows z-order gets the focus.
