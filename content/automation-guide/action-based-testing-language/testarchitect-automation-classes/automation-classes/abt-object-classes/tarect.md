## {{< expand >}} Description

A TARect specifies an area in a coordinate space that is defined by the TARect object's top-left point \(x, y\) in the coordinate space, its width, and its height.

## Constructors

-   **TARect\(\)**

    Constructs a new TARect whose top-left corner is at \(0, 0\) in the coordinate space, and whose width and height are both zero

-   **TARect\(long left, long top, long width, long height\)**

    Constructs a new TARect whose top-left corner is specified as \(x, y\) and whose width and height are specified by the arguments of the same name.

    left - The x coordinate of the TARect.

    top - The y coordinate of the TARect.

    width - The width of the TARect.

    height - The height of the TARect.


## Methods

-   **GetLeft\(\)**

    Return the x coordinate of the bounding TARect.

-   **GetTop\(\)**

    Return the y coordinate of the bounding TARect.

-   **GetWidth\(\)**

    Return the width of the bounding TARect.

-   **GetHeight\(\)**

    Return the height of the bounding TARect.
