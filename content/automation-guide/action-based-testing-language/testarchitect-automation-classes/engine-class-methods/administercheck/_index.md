## Syntax

`integer AdministerCheck(string label, string expected, string recorded, integer result)`

## Description

Report and record the result of a user check already performed.

## Parameters

-   **label**

    Title for the check, to be displayed in the report. This is a documentary parameter that has no influence on the check itself.

-   **expected**

    Expected value for the check. \(For reporting purposes only.\)

-   **recorded**

    Recorded value that was compared against the expected value. \(For reporting purposes only.\)

-   ****

## Return Value
The function returns the value of the *result* parameter. 


## Notes

-   -   Use AdministerCheckArgument or AdministerCheckNamedArgument if possible, since these functions allow for better reporting \(in particular when used in action definitions\).
-   The functions AdministerCheck can be used to administer the result of a check already done in a script. They are typically used when the check is not a comparison between an expected and a recorded string \(like "check if the response time is below 8 seconds"\).
