Expressions allow you to apply basic operations such as addition, division, and concatenation to operands, in order to produce a value. Often, however, you need to perform more complex operations in order to derive a value you need. Moreover, sometimes you need to obtain a value \(today's date, for instance\) which cannot be derived from the data within your test. Functions are prewritten operations which you can reference by name within your expressions to produce values needed by your test.

1.  [Date functions](/automation-guide/action-based-testing-language/the-test-language/functions/date-functions/)  
Date functions compute and convert Gregorian dates to and from Julian day numbers.
2.  [Number functions](/automation-guide/action-based-testing-language/the-test-language/functions/number-functions/)  
Functions that are useful for manipulating numeric data.
3.  [String functions](/automation-guide/action-based-testing-language/the-test-language/functions/string-functions/)  
String functions include such functions as examining individual characters of a sequence, searching strings, extracting substrings, and creating a copy of a string with characters translated to upper or lowercase.
4.  [Variable function](/automation-guide/action-based-testing-language/the-test-language/functions/variable-function/)  
The getglobal function is used to retrieve a global variable's value.
