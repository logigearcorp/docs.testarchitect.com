The critical wait settings \(window wait, page wait, object wait, item wait and property wait\) are those which are used for conditions and preconditions which, if not satisfied, result in a warning or failing of a test.

In some cases, the [condition/precondition](/automation-guide/action-based-testing-language/the-test-language/timing/understanding-action-types-and-condition-types/conditions-and-preconditions) you are testing is something of a show-stopper: if it is not satisfied, the action either cannot complete execution and must report a warning \(for preconditions\), or must report a fail for the test \(for checkâ€¦exists conditions\). The timing settings for these critical waits are:

-   **[window wait](/automation-guide/action-based-testing-language/built-in-settings/timing-settings/window-wait)**

    Applies to UI windows, including browser windows. Used for preconditions that require the existence of a window, and for conditions that require the existence or nonexistence of a window.

-   **[page wait](/automation-guide/action-based-testing-language/built-in-settings/timing-settings/page-wait)**

    Applies to HTML pages in a browser window.

-   **[object wait](/automation-guide/action-based-testing-language/built-in-settings/timing-settings/object-wait)**

    Applies to UI controls and HTML elements.

-   **[item wait](/automation-guide/action-based-testing-language/built-in-settings/timing-settings/item-wait)**

    Applies to UI items such as tree nodes, menu items, list items and table cells.

    {{<note>}} item wait is not exclusively used as a critical wait timer. See note below for [object wait probe](/automation-guide/action-based-testing-language/built-in-settings/timing-settings/object-wait-probe).

-   **[property wait](/automation-guide/action-based-testing-language/built-in-settings/timing-settings/property-wait)**

    Applies to the various properties of UI elements.


The example below demonstrates three critical wait settings - [window wait](/automation-guide/action-based-testing-language/built-in-settings/timing-settings/window-wait), [object wait](/automation-guide/action-based-testing-language/built-in-settings/timing-settings/object-wait) and [item wait](/automation-guide/action-based-testing-language/built-in-settings/timing-settings/item-wait) - used as timers for preconditions of the [get table cell value](/automation-guide/action-based-testing-language/built-in-actions/user-interface-actions/list-table-grid/get-table-cell-value) action. When executed, the action first looks for the presence of the View Orders window; if it must wait for the window to appear, that wait is governed by the [window wait](/automation-guide/action-based-testing-language/built-in-settings/timing-settings/window-wait) timer. A timeout results in a warning for the test, whereas discovery of the window allows the action to proceed to its next stage. A similar case is true for the next two stages of finding the specified object \(a table\), and the specified item \(a specific cell of the table\).

{{<note>}} This action, get table cell value, also uses the non-critical timing setting value changed wait. For purposes of this topic, that is ignored here, but is discussed later.
