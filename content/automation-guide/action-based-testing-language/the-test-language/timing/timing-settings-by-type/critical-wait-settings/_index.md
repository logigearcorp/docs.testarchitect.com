The critical wait settings \(window wait, page wait, object wait, item wait and property wait\) are those which are used for conditions and preconditions which, if not satisfied, result in a warning or failing of a test.

In some cases, the [condition/precondition](/TA_Automation/Topics/timing_preconditions.html) you are testing is something of a show-stopper: if it is not satisfied, the action either cannot complete execution and must report a warning \(for preconditions\), or must report a fail for the test \(for checkâ€¦exists conditions\). The timing settings for these critical waits are:

-   **[window wait](/TA_Automation/Topics/bis_window_wait.html)**

    Applies to UI windows, including browser windows. Used for preconditions that require the existence of a window, and for conditions that require the existence or nonexistence of a window.

-   **[page wait](/TA_Automation/Topics/bis_page_wait.html)**

    Applies to HTML pages in a browser window.

-   **[object wait](/TA_Automation/Topics/bis_object_wait.html)**

    Applies to UI controls and HTML elements.

-   **[item wait](/TA_Automation/Topics/bis_item_wait.html)**

    Applies to UI items such as tree nodes, menu items, list items and table cells.

{{<note>}} item wait is not exclusively used as a critical wait timer. See note below for [object wait probe](/TA_Automation/Topics/bis_object_wait_probe.html).

-   **[property wait](/TA_Automation/Topics/bis_property_wait.html)**

    Applies to the various properties of UI elements.


The example below demonstrates three critical wait settings - [window wait](/TA_Automation/Topics/bis_window_wait.html), [object wait](/TA_Automation/Topics/bis_object_wait.html) and [item wait](/TA_Automation/Topics/bis_item_wait.html) - used as timers for preconditions of the [get table cell value](/TA_Automation/Topics/bia_get_table_cell_value.html) action. When executed, the action first looks for the presence of the View Orders window; if it must wait for the window to appear, that wait is governed by the [window wait](/TA_Automation/Topics/bis_window_wait.html) timer. A timeout results in a warning for the test, whereas discovery of the window allows the action to proceed to its next stage. A similar case is true for the next two stages of finding the specified object \(a table\), and the specified item \(a specific cell of the table\).

{{<note>}} This action, get table cell value, also uses the non-critical timing setting value changed wait. For purposes of this topic, that is ignored here, but is discussed later.
