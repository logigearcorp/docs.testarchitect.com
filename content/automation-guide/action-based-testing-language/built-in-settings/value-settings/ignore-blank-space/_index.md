# ignore blank space

## Description

Ignore spaces at the beginning or end of strings.

## Allowable values

-   **yes**

    Ignore spaces at the beginning or the end of a string

-   **no**

    Do not ignore spaces at the beginning or the end of a string.


## Default value

yes

## Notes

-   By default, TestArchitect trims the leading and trailing spaces from text strings that it captures from the AUT before making the values available to groups of built-in actions that are used to match or compare the values, such as, [check](bia_check.html), [click list item](bia_click_list_item.html), [select](bia_select.html), etc. You now have the option to skip that processing, leaving any leading or trailing spaces in place.
-   The TestArchitect interpreter automatically strips leading and trailing whitespace from argument values. When you want to distinguish between a given string that has leading or trailing spaces and one that doesn't, there are two approaches you can take.

    The following examples demonstrate how we can detect the string " prius" â€“ that is, "prius", with a leading space:

    -   apply the \#char\(\) function with a value of 32 \(ASCII space\) \([learn more](Expressions_functions_char.html)\), and set [ignore blank space](bis_ignore_blank_space.html) to no, so as to avoid trimming spaces from captured AUT property values.

        ```
                   setting                value
        setting    ignore blank space     no
        
                   window                 control    value
        check      view cars              type       #char(32) & "prius"
        ```

    -   Enclose the argument value, including space, in double quotation marks. Preceding that, apply the [remove double quotes from cell](bis_remove_double_quotes_from_cells.html) built-in setting with a value of true to have the interpreter strip the quotation marks. Again, ensure that ignore blank space is set to no to avoid trimming spaces from the captured property value.

        ```
                       setting                             value
        setting        remove double quotes from cell      true
        setting        ignore blank space                  no
                                        
                       window                              control      value
        check          view cars                           type         " prius" 
        ```

-   On web browsers, a space may be in the form of either a white space \(ASCII code \#32\), or a non-breaking space \(ASCII code \#160\). Hence, checking for a space in a property value of a web control may involve applying char\(32\), char\(160\), or both. Note however, that the [standard ASCII only](bis_standard_ASCII_only.html) built-in setting, by default, discards any characters whose decimal ASCII codes are not within the range of 32-127. Consequently, to prevent the loss of ASCII \#160 characters in captured text values, set standard ASCII only to no. For example:

    ```
                 setting                   value
    setting      ignore blank space        no
    setting      standard ASCII only       no
    
                 window                    control    value
    check        name                      type       # char(32) & "prius"
    check        name                      type       # char(160) & "prius"
    ```
