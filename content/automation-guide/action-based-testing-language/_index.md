Action Based Testing \(ABT\) is usually considered to be an automation technique. It is commonly positioned as an advanced and practical alternative to other techniques like "record & playback" or "scripting". Much about ABT is discussed in the following pages.

1.  [The test language](/TA_Automation/Topics/The_test_language.html)  
Most tests consist of a sequence of action lines, with their action keywords and arguments. Actions are available as built-in actions, or can be created as user actions, implemented either with action definitions or programmed in an automation harness.
2.  [Built-in actions](/TA_Automation/Topics/bia_Built_in_actions.html)  
TestArchitect includes a library of built-in actions to perform a myriad of functions.
3.  [Built-in settings](/TA_Automation/Topics/bis_Built_in_settings.html)  
TestArchitect has a number of built-in settings that control various runtime behaviors of TestArchitect.
4.  [TestArchitect Automation Classes](/TA_Automation/Topics/abt_automation_classes.html)  
Language independent syntax line notations, and basic functions in TestArchitect automation and engine classes.
