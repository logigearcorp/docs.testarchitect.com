## Description

Wait a specified amount of time for a given control to appear before executing the next action line.

## Arguments

-   **window**

    TA name of the window.

-   **control**

    TA name of the control.

-   **timeout\(second\)**

    \(Optional\) Maximum time to wait \(units: seconds; default = current value of the [object wait](/automation-guide/action-based-testing-language/built-in-settings/timing-settings/object-wait) built-in setting â€“ see note below\).


## Valid contexts

This action may be used within the following project items:test modules and user-defined actions.

## Notes

-   If the given control fails to appear before the specified timeout, a warning is generated. By default \(that is, unless the [notice level](/automation-guide/action-based-testing-language/built-in-settings/other-settings/notice-level) setting has been modified in your test\) you are presented with a modal dialog box asking whether to continue the test.
-   If no value is specified for the timeout\(second\) argument, the current value of the built-in setting [object wait](/automation-guide/action-based-testing-language/built-in-settings/timing-settings/object-wait) is used. [object wait](/automation-guide/action-based-testing-language/built-in-settings/timing-settings/object-wait), if not otherwise set in a [setting](/automation-guide/action-based-testing-language/built-in-actions/test-support-actions/value-handling/setting) action line, defaults to a value of 20 seconds.
-   Whenever possible, it is recommended that you use the built-in [object wait](/automation-guide/action-based-testing-language/built-in-settings/timing-settings/object-wait) setting, along with the appropriate built-in action, in lieu of wait for control.
-   This action supports the [<ignore\>](/automation-guide/action-based-testing-language/the-test-language/ignoring-actions) modifier. If the string `<ignore>` is present as the value of any of the arguments, or any argument contains an expression that evaluates to `<ignore>`, the action is skipped during execution.

## Applicable Built-In Settings
