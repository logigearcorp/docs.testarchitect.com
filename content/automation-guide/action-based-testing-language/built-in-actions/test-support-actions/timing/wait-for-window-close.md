## Description

Wait a specified amount of time for a given window to close before executing the next action line.

## Arguments

-   **window**

    TA name of the window.

-   **time out**

    \(Optional\) Maximum time to wait \(units: seconds; default = current value of the [window wait](/automation-guide/action-based-testing-language/built-in-settings/timing-settings/window-wait) built-in setting â€“ see note below\).

-   **time out**

    \(Optional\) Maximum time to wait \(units: seconds\).


## Valid contexts

This action may be used within the following project items:test modules and user-defined actions.

## Notes

-   If the given window does not close before the specified timeout, a warning is generated. By default \(that is, unless the [notice level](/automation-guide/action-based-testing-language/built-in-settings/other-settings/notice-level) setting has been modified in your test\) you are presented with a modal dialog box asking whether to continue the test.
-   If the given window does not close before the specified timeout, a warning is generated. You are presented with a modal dialog box asking whether to continue the test.
-   If no value is specified for the time out argument, the current value of the built-in setting [window wait](/automation-guide/action-based-testing-language/built-in-settings/timing-settings/window-wait) is used. [window wait](/automation-guide/action-based-testing-language/built-in-settings/timing-settings/window-wait), if not otherwise set in a setting action line, defaults to a value of 20 seconds.
-   Whenever possible, it is recommended that you use the built-in [window wait](/automation-guide/action-based-testing-language/built-in-settings/timing-settings/window-wait) setting, along with the appropriate built-in action, in lieu of wait for window close.
-   This action supports the [<ignore\>](/automation-guide/action-based-testing-language/the-test-language/ignoring-actions) modifier. If the string `<ignore>` is present as the value of any of the arguments, or any argument contains an expression that evaluates to `<ignore>`, the action is skipped during execution.

## Applicable Built-In Settings

The following settings are applicable to this action:[case sensitive](/automation-guide/action-based-testing-language/built-in-settings/value-settings/case-sensitive), [remove double quotes from cells](/automation-guide/action-based-testing-language/built-in-settings/value-settings/remove-double-quotes-from-cells), [standard ASCII only](/automation-guide/action-based-testing-language/built-in-settings/value-settings/standard-ascii-only), [window wait](/automation-guide/action-based-testing-language/built-in-settings/timing-settings/window-wait).

## Example

Suppose that while testing a multi-window application, you have a window that pops up and you want to wait for that window to disappear, before the next action line in the test is executed.
