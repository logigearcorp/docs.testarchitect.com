The optical character recognition actions include built-in actions which use OCR to discern text from bitmap images captured from the AUT.

1.  [check text exists](/automation-guide/action-based-testing-language/built-in-actions/user-interface-actions/optical-character-recognition/check-text-exists)  

2.  [check text not exists](/automation-guide/action-based-testing-language/built-in-actions/user-interface-actions/optical-character-recognition/check-text-not-exists)  

3.  [clear ocr setting](/automation-guide/action-based-testing-language/built-in-actions/user-interface-actions/optical-character-recognition/clear-ocr-setting)
