## Notes

    -   For Safari
        -   on iOS, refer to [Handling JavaScript popups on Safari iOS](aut_app_testing_safari_apps_popups.html) for details.

-   variable argument:
    -   For convenience, the argument headersvariable, variable0 and variable1are all used to reference the same item \(that is, the message text of the most recently handled popup\).
    -   Each variableargument is numbered in accordance with the order of handled popups in the current popup session, in reverse chronological order. Specifically,variablespecifies the most recently handled popup,variable2the second most recent, and so on.
    -   A single call to this action may be used to retrieve any or all of the handled popup messages of the current popup session. Specify as manyvariable arguments as there are messages you wish to retrieve, taking care to number them \(variable2, variable5, etc.\) in correspondence with the popups of interest. \(See [Example \#2](bia_get_popup_message.html#section.ex02).\)
    -   If the variables in argumentsvariable, variable2, variable3, etc.have not been declared, the action creates them as globals.
-   This action supports the [<ignore\>](/images//Images/TA_Automation/Topics/Ignoring_action.html) modifier. If the string `<ignore>` is present as the value of the argument, or the argument contains an expression that evaluates to `<ignore>`, the action is skipped during execution.

    -   The message of the second most recently handled popup \(the confirmation popup\).
    -   The messages of both popups.
