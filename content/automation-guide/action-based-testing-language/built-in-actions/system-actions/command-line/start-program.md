## {{< expand >}} Description

Launch a specified application on the test machine.

## {{< expand >}} Arguments

-   **program**

    The program to be started, prepended with its execution path, if necessary.

    For mobile devices:

    -   **Android**: the application package name. \(See also note below.\)
    -   **iOS**: the application name. \(See also note below.\)
-   **parameter**

    \(Optional\) A parameter or string, such as the name of a data file, to be passed to the launched program.

    {{<note>}} parameter is an invisible argument. To use it, you must specify both the value and parameter header in the column to the right of the program argument.


## {{< expand >}} Valid contexts

This action may be used within the following project items:test modules and user-defined actions.

## {{< expand >}} Notes

-   **iOS:** To ensure that start program can successfully launch an application on an iOS device, refer to [Launching an AUT](/automation-guide/application-testing/mobile-testing/testing-mobile-applications/ios-automation/launching-an-aut#section_pdh_mzj_m4).
-   program argument:
    -   For an iOS device, theprogramargument should hold the name of the running application itself, e.g. Car Rental. If needed, you can obtain the application's name through the Interface Viewer:
        1.  Launch the [Interface Viewer](/user-guide/interface-definitions/the-interface-viewer/starting-the-interface-viewer) and then switch to your connected iOS device.
        2.  In the Properties panel of the **TA Properties** tab, search for the name property containing the application's name. Note that you will find the string Normal Z1 appended to the application name, e.g. Car Rental Normal Z1.
        3.  Right-click the property and then select **Copy Value**.
        4.  In the test editor, paste the copied value into theprogramargument of the built-in action, then manually delete the appended Normal Z1 string from the name.
    -   On an Android device, program is the package name of the running application. To obtain the package name of an Android application::
        1.  Open the [Android Instrumentation Tool](/automation-guide/application-testing/mobile-testing/testing-mobile-applications/android-automation/android-instrumentation-tool/) dialog box.
        2.  In the Application Under Test panel, right-click the appropriate application, and then select **Copy package name**.

        3.  Paste the copied value into the program argument within your action lines.
-   parameter argument:
    -   parameteris an unsupported argument and hence invisible. To use it, you must specify both its value and header, in the cell to the right of last visible argument.
    -   An alternative to using the parameter argument is to simply append its contents to the program argument, delimited by a space.
-   For the execution path, you may use the standard execution file path format of the operating system \(e.g., in Windows: C:\\Program Files\\Acme\\foo.exe\). The execution file path may also use the forward slash delimiter \(C:/Program Files/Acme/foo.exe\), regardless of operating system.
-   A full path is not required if the directory in which the program resides is listed in the execution search path environment variable of the operating system \(%PATH% in Windows, $PATH in Linux\). For example, full paths need not be specified for such applications as Windowsâ€™ Notepad, Calc, and cmd, because the directory in which their executables reside is always included in the system %PATH% variable.
-   On iOS devices, a full path is not required even if your app is grouped under an app folder; only the app's name is required.
-   This action supports the [<ignore\>](/automation-guide/action-based-testing-language/the-test-language/ignoring-actions) modifier. If the string `<ignore>` is present as the value of any of the arguments, or any argument contains an expression that evaluates to `<ignore>`, the action is skipped during execution.

## {{< expand >}} Applicable Built-In Settings

The following settings are applicable to this action:[remove double quotes from cells](/automation-guide/action-based-testing-language/built-in-settings/value-settings/remove-double-quotes-from-cells)none .

## Example - Case 1: Starting an application

**Result**

## Example - Case 2: Starting an application that accepts an argument

Say you want to open a text file with the Notepad++ application. Since Notepad++ accepts the path of a text file as a command line argument, we can specify the file when we launch the application. We have two options for doing this.

**Option 1: Using the parameter argument:**

**Option 2: Including the argument to the application in the program argument:**
