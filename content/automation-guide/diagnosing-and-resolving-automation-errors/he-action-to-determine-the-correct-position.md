Error code: 0x8001000EL

## Problem

This happens because the required argument header name is reordered into an invalid column, or even deleted..

## Solution

Try either the following ways:

-   Look up the correct column of the argument header by pressing F1 on the action to invoke TestArchitect Help.
-   Retype the built-in action on the editor. The new action replaces the existing one, along with new argument headers.
