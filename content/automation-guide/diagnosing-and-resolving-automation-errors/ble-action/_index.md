Error code: 0x80010011L

## Problem

This happens because you use a built-in action to interact with an unsupported control. For example, use table-related built-in actions, such as, [get table cell containing](/TA_Automation/Topics/bia_get_table_cell_containing.html), to access a toolbar control.

## Solution

You can try using [applicable action suggestions](/TA_Help/Topics/ug_applicable_actions.html) for a window or control. Content Assist's applicable actions list provides you with a convenient means of viewing and selecting from the list of actions available for a given UI element.
