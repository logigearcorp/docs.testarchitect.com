Error code: 0x80010003L

## Problem

This happens because the specified control is not defined yet.

## Solution

Capture the desired control by using the [Interface Viewer](/TA_Help/Topics/Interface_def_Viewer.html) or [point-to-identify](/TA_Help/Topics/Interface_def_client_interface_tool_identify.html) tool, and then re-run the test.
