Error code: 0x80018007L

## Problem

This issue occurs when you apply the [use cloud device](/TA_Automation/Topics/bia_use_cloud_device.html) built-in action to invoke a specific cloud device; however, that device is currently busy, such as, running another automated test.

## Solution

Ensure that the cloud device is available at the moment it is called to run tests.
