Error code: 0x80010003L

## Problem

This happens because the specified control is not defined yet.

## Solution

Capture the desired control by using the [Interface Viewer](/user-guide/interface-definitions/the-interface-viewer/) or [point-to-identify](/user-guide/interface-definitions/interface-capturing-commands/point-to-identify-tool/) tool, and then re-run the test.
