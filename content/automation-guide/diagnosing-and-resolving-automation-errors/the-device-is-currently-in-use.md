## {{< expand >}} Problem {{< permerlink >}} {#reference_0x80018007L__section_um5_jvb_2y} 

This issue occurs when you apply the [use cloud device](/automation-guide/action-based-testing-language/built-in-actions/system-actions/device/use-cloud-device) built-in action to invoke a specific cloud device; however, that device is currently busy, such as, running another automated test.

## {{< expand >}} Solution {{< permerlink >}} {#reference_0x80018007L__section_vm5_jvb_2y} 

Ensure that the cloud device is available at the moment it is called to run tests.
