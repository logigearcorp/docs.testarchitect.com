Error code: 0x80018004L

## Problem

This issue happens when you invoke a specific cloud device which has been invoked to run your tests.

## Solution

Ensure that your [use cloud device](/TA_Automation/Topics/bia_use_cloud_device.html) action invokes a different cloud device, or simply remove that [use cloud device](/TA_Automation/Topics/bia_use_cloud_device.html) action in the tests.
