# Applications Under Test panel {#Applications_Under_Test_area .concept}

The Applications Under Test panel displays all the testable applications installed on the selected device.

Built-in applications are not testable. Testable Android applications are applications which have been re-signed by TestArchitect \(see [Installing a testable Android application](Installing_applications.html)\). Re-signing of an application is required to allow TestArchitect to interface with that application. Applications that have not been re-signed are not displayed on the **Applications Under Test** panel, and TestArchitect cannot interface with them.

**Tip:** It may be necessary to click the **Refresh AUTs list** ![](../Images/Refresh_AUT_list_btn.png) button to update the list of AUTS on the Applications Under Test panel in order to view recently installed AUTs.
