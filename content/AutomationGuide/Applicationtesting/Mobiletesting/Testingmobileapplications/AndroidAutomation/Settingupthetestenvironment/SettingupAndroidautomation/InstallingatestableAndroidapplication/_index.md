# Installing a testable Android application {#Installing_applications .concept}

Installing an application on a target device for testing purposes is a two-step process which involves re-signing and installing the application.

**Note:**

-   Android automation is only supported on Windows, or Linux hosts.
-   You must have an administrative right to re-sign \(only for the first re-signing\) and install applications under test on the Android mobile device.
