# Android cloud devices {#concept_rgg_hff_f5 .concept}

Describes prerequisites and automation cloud testing on Android mobile devices.

The makers of Remote TestKit offer their service as either a web application, accessible immediately from a web browser, or by means of a client software application. For automating with TestArchitect, however, it is necessary that you [download](https://appkitbox.com/en/testkit/download) and [install](https://appkitbox.com/en/testkit/support/signin/signin13) the Remote TestKit Client application.

1.  [Prerequisites](../../TA_Automation/Topics/aut_app_cloud_testing_Android_prerequisites.html)  
Guides to setting up WebView, and native applications on cloud Android devices, so that they may be automated under TestArchitect.
2.  [Cloud automation testing](../../TA_Automation/Topics/aut_app_cloud_testing_Android.html)  
After having completed the prerequisites, you can now start to automate your tests on the target cloud devices.
