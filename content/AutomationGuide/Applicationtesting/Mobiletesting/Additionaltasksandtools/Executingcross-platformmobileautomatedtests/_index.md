# Executing cross-platform mobile automated tests {#mobile_automation_FAQ_cross_platform_mobile_testing .concept}

TestArchitect provides a [Variations](../../TA_Help/Topics/Variations.html) feature that makes creating cross-platform mobile tests easier. Additionally, the [Car Rental Mobile](../../TA_Tutorials_Sample_App/Topics/SR_Car_Rental_mobile_def.html) sample project is provided with installation of TestArchitect to give you a better understanding of how to use [Variations](../../TA_Help/Topics/Variations.html) in creating cross-platform mobile tests.

**Note:** The supported mobile platforms are [Android](../../Android/Topics/Android_Automation_begin.html) and [iOS](../../iOS/Topics/iOS_automation_def.html).

To perform cross-platform mobile tests, complete the following steps.

1.  [Creating a new platform](../../TA_Automation/Topics/Mobile_automation_variations_create_new_system.html)  
How to create a new platform to support cross-platform mobile testing.
2.  [Creating a new version node](../../TA_Automation/Topics/Mobile_automation_variations_create_new_version.html)  
How to create different types of mobile platforms to support cross-platform mobile testing.
3.  [Linking a variation to a version](../../TA_Automation/Topics/Mobile_automation_variations_linking.html)  
After creating different types of mobile platforms, you need to link your interfaces/actions to the mobile platforms.
4.  [Executing a test with variations](../../TA_Automation/Topics/Mobile_automation_variations_executing.html)
