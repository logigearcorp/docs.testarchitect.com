# The device is currently in use. {#reference_0x80018007L .reference}

Error code: 0x80018007L

## Problem {#section_um5_jvb_2y .section}

This issue occurs when you apply the [use cloud device](../../TA_Automation/Topics/bia_use_cloud_device.html) built-in action to invoke a specific cloud device; however, that device is currently busy, such as, running another automated test.

## Solution {#section_vm5_jvb_2y .section}

Ensure that the cloud device is available at the moment it is called to run tests.
