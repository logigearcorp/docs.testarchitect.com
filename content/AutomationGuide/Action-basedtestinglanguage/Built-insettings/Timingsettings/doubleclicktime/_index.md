# double click time {#bis_double_click_time .reference}

## Description { .section}

Set the interval between clicks for TestArchitect to use in applying double-clicks. A double-click is a series of two clicks of the mouse button, the second occurring within a specified time after the first.

## Allowable value { .section}

Integer value whose lower limit is the test system's minimum allowable double-click interval, and whose upper limit is the current double-click time of the host system, in milliseconds.

**Note:**

-   The maximum value must not exceed the current double-click time of the host system, so that, the system can detect the two clicks generated by TestArchitect as a double-click.

-   To change the system's speed at which you double-click the mouse button, in the Mouse Properties window, press Alt+ D and using the arrow keys or click on the pointer, move it to make the setting slower or faster. \(See [To change how the mouse button work](http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/change-mouse-settings#1TC=windows-7).\)

-   On Windows:
    -   The minimum value is 200 milliseconds.
    -   The maximum value is the current double-click time of the system.

## Default value { .section}

Current double-click time of the host system minus 50 milliseconds.

## Notes { .section}

-   The double click time built-in setting affects only the interval between clicks that TestArchitect applies when a built-in action is required to supply a double click to an AUT. An example is the [click](bia_click.html) action when its click type argument has a value of double. Using this built-in setting does not alter the double-click time of the host system.

## Example { .section}

**Scenario**: Suppose that your AUT is running on a virtual machine with slow performance; thus, you may slow down the speed at which you need to double-click by setting a new value that is as close to the host system's value as possible. This ensures that the click built-in action takes effect properly.
