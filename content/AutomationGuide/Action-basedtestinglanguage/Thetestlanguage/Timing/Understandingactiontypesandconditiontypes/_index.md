# **Understanding action types and condition types** {#timing_intro_action_and_condition_types .concept}

For a full understanding of timing settings and their effects, it is helpful to understand the types of UI-related action, and the two types of UI-testing conditions.



1.  [Classifying UI-interactive actions](../../TA_Automation/Topics/timing_classifying_actions.html)  
Timing settings used for a given action are largely determined by the type of action it is. Actions that interact with the AUT can be classified into UI-testing and UI-interfacing actions. Each group can be further classified into subgroups.
2.  [Conditions and preconditions](../../TA_Automation/Topics/timing_preconditions.html)  
 The execution of an action may involve one or more UI-related tests that must be satisfied before the primary function of the action can be executed.
