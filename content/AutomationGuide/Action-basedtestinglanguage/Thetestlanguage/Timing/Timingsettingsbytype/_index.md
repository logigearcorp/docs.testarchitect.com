# Timing settings by type {#timing_settings_classified .concept}

Timing settings can be roughly broken down into two types: critical and non-critical.



-   **[Critical wait settings](../../TA_Automation/Topics/timing_critical_wait_settings.html)**  
 The critical wait settings \(window wait, page wait, object wait, item wait and property wait\) are those which are used for conditions and preconditions which, if not satisfied, result in a warning or failing of a test.
-   **[Non-critical wait settings](../../TA_Automation/Topics/timing_noncritical_wait_settings.html)**  
 Non-critical wait settings \(window wait probe, object wait probe, and value changed wait\) are not associated with interruptions of normal program flow.
-   **[Timing settings, actions and conditions](../../TA_Automation/Topics/timing_settings_actions_conditions.html)**  
 A summary of the relationship between timing settings, action types, and associated conditions and preconditions.
