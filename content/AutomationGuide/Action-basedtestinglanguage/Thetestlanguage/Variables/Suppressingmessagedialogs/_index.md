# Suppressing message dialogs {#error_handling_suppress_messages .concept}

Use the set notice level action to specify the types of problem-related messages that are inhibited from being displayed during the test run.

Unanticipated message boxes from the test automation are a common problem of testing because they often require human intervention, resulting in unexpected disruptions during a test run. To help reduce unanticipated messages, TestArchitect offers four levels of message suppression. The [set notice level](bia_set_notice_level.html) action is used to set message notice levels, with the lowest value \(0\) being the most restrictive, and the highest \(3\) permitting all possible messages to be displayed.
