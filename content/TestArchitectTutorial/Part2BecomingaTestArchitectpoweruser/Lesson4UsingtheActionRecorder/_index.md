# Lesson \#4: Using the Action Recorder {#overview_bsc_hvs_pr .learningOverview}

TestArchitect can generate tests by recording your interactions with the application under test.

The Action Recorder allows for the recording of control actions \(for example, click and enter\) as well as testing actions \(for example, check and check control property\).

**Audience:** Testers, Automation engineers

**Prerequisites:**

-   Basic understanding of the TestArchitect Client user interface
-   Familiarity with the TestArchitect test editor
-   Essential understanding of TestArchitect repositories, projects and tests

**What you will learn:**

-   How to record actions on controls
-   How to generate a check action
-   How to update interface definitions using Action Recorder

1.  [Introduction to the Action Recorder](../../TA_Tutorials/Topics/Action_Recorder_Introduction.html)  
Streamline the process of creating test modules and actions by letting TestArchitect record your manual actions and translate them into action lines.
2.  [Recording control actions](../../TA_Tutorials/Topics/Recording_control_actions.html)  
How to use the Action Recorder to record interactions with UI controls in the sample application.
3.  [Recording check actions on controls](../../TA_Tutorials/Topics/Defining_Check_Action_on_Control.html)  
Insert validity checks during your recording sessions to generate action lines that check the output of the AUT during automated testing.
4.  [Updating interface definitions](../../TA_Tutorials/Topics/Updating_interface_definitions.html)  
When the Action Recorder generates actions that operate on windows and controls, it populates the arguments of those actions with TA names. If necessary, it allows you to define those names "on the fly".
