# Applying customized action {#task_bfl_hb3_jm .task}

You have customized the built-in action get list item count to work with Telerikâ€™s list box control. Now, you will apply that customized action.

1.  Close the AUT if it is still running, and re-open it.

2.  Reuse the following action line, which was created in the [earlier step](WPF_Extensibility_mapping_unknown_class.md#step_mrr_cg3_jm).

3.  Click **Execute** ![](../Images/btn.TAC_toolbar.Execute.png) on the toolbar to execute the test.

    The Execute Test dialog box appears.

4.  Click **Execute**.

    TestArchitect returns the actual total number of items, which is three. This actual number matches the expected number.
