# Lesson \#10: WPF Extensibility {#overview_qcp_k1t_pr .learningOverview}

TestArchitect supports every WPF control with an exception to very few specific controls, such as Telerik list box control. Therefore, there is a need to have a solution to this issue. The WPF Extensibility solution provides a public API which you can use to override TestArchitect's built-in actions.

**Audience:** Testers, Automation engineers, Software developers

**Prerequisites:**

-   Installation of TestArchitect Client
-   Basic understanding of the TestArchitect user interface
-   Familiarity with the TestArchitect test editor
-   Some familiarity with C\# programming language

    **Remember:** It is highly recommended that you use Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 to program WPF Extensibility.


**What you will learn:**

-   How to map an unknown class to a supported TestArchitect class
-   How to create WPF Extensibility
-   Applying the customized built-in actions
-   The overall architecture and workflow activities of WPF Extensibility

1.  [Scenario](../../TA_Tutorials/Topics/WPF_extensibility_scenario.html)  
Suppose that we are running an AUT based on Telerik controls, and we may want to get the total number of items in a list box control.
2.  [Technical reference](../../TA_Tutorials/Topics/WPF_extensibility_techinical_reference.html)  
This section explains the WPF Extensibility overview and its workflow.
