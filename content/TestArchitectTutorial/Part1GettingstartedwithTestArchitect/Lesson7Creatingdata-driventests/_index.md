# Lesson \#7: Creating data-driven tests {#overview_jkp_1xs_pr .learningOverview}

Demonstrates how to enhance your tests with external test data to better simulate real-world user actions.

**Audience:** Testers, Automation engineers

**Prerequisites:**

-   Basic understanding of the TestArchitect user interface
-   Familiarity with the TestArchitect test editor
-   Essential understanding of TestArchitect repositories, projects, and tests

**What you will learn:**

-   Creating data sets
-   Incorporating data sets into your test
-   Reading data from external files
-   Filtering incoming data

1.  [Data-driven testing overview](../../TA_Tutorials/Topics/Data_driven_testing_overview.html)  
With data-driven testing, a test sequence is executed repeatedly using values from a data source. For each test cycle, a different row of data is applied.
2.  [Data-driven tests](../../TA_Tutorials/Topics/Data-driven_tests.html)  
Automated test sequences can be run repeatedly using sets of data supplied from a repository source external to the test.
3.  [Creating a data set](../../TA_Tutorials/Topics/Creating_a_data_set.html)  
Data sets are sources of simulated real-world user data, and expected outcomes, for TestArchitect tests.
4.  [Creating a data-driven test](../../TA_Tutorials/Topics/Creating_a_data-driven_test.html)  
Write a test that relies on an external data source \(a data set, in this case\) to simulate real-world user input.
5.  [Running the test](../../TA_Tutorials/Topics/Running_the_test_3.html)  
 Execute a test with multiple data records \(rows\) supplied by a data set.
6.  [External data sources](../../TA_Tutorials/Topics/External_data_sources.html)  
 In addition to data sets, text files residing outside of the TestArchitect repository may also be used to supply data to tests.
7.  [Creating an external data source](../../TA_Tutorials/Topics/Creating_an_external_data_source.html)  
Create a tab-delimited text file to supply data sets to your test.
8.  [Creating a dummy data set](../../TA_Tutorials/Topics/Creating_a_dummy_data_set.html)  
To connect a test to an external data source, you must create a dummy data set to provide a crucial link to the file.
9.  [Accessing external data from the test](../../TA_Tutorials/Topics/Accessing_external_data_from_the_test.html)  
Setting up a data-driven test to accept data from an external text file.
10. [Running the test](../../TA_Tutorials/Topics/Running_the_test_5.html)  
Execute a test with multiple records \(rows\) of data supplied by an external data file.
11. [Using filters](../../TA_Tutorials/Topics/Data_set_filters.html)  
You can apply filters to your data set to limit the sets of data applied to your test.
12. [Applying a data filter](../../TA_Tutorials/Topics/Applying_a_data_filter.html)  
Add a filter to your test to limit the data coming in.
13. [Named filters](../../TA_Tutorials/Topics/Named_data_set_filters.html)  
Named filters are established in a data set and may be referenced in your tests.
14. [Summary: What you learned](../../TA_Tutorials/Topics/Summary_Creating_data_driven_tests.html)
